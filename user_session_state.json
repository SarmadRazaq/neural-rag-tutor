Sampling Distributions and Estimation\" and \"Chapter 12. Hypothesis Testing,\" together provide a foundational introduction to **inferential statistics**. They explain how to use data from a sample to make educated guesses and formal decisions about a larger population.\n\nHere's a breakdown of each chapter:\n\n### Chapter 11: Sampling Distributions and Estimation \ud83d\udcd8\n\nThis chapter lays the groundwork for understanding how samples relate to populations and how to estimate population parameters.\n\n*   **11.1 Surveys and Sampling:**\n    *   **Census vs. Sample:** Explains why samples are used instead of censuses (measuring every unit in a population) due to practicality, cost, and potential destructiveness. \ud83d\udcd8\n    *   **Sampling Error vs. Bias:** Introduces \"sampling error\" as random variation between a sample and population, often called \"margin of error.\" \"Bias\" refers to systematic errors that lead to non-representative samples. \ud83d\udcd8\n    *   **Types of Bias:** Details various sources of bias, including:\n        *   **Sampling Bias:** Related to the selection method.\n            *   *Incorrect Sampling Frame:* When the list from which the sample is chosen doesn't accurately reflect the population (leading to \"undercoverage\"). \ud83d\udcd8\n            *   *Convenience Sampling:* Selecting easily accessible individuals. \ud83d\udcd8\n            *   *Judgment Sampling:* An expert subjectively chooses individuals. \ud83d\udcd8\n            *   *Size Bias:* When larger subgroups are over-represented. \ud83d\udcd8\n        *   **Response Bias:** Related to how the survey is presented or responded to.\n            *   *Voluntary Response Bias:* Self-selection by individuals with strong opinions. \ud83d\udcd8\n            *   *Non-Response Bias:* When many selected individuals don't respond. \ud83d\udcd8\n            *   *Questionnaire Bias:* Wording of questions influences responses. \ud83d\udcd8\n            *   *Incorrect Response Bias:* Individuals provide untruthful answers. \ud83d\udcd8\n    *   **Reducing Bias (Sampling Methods):** Discusses techniques to improve sample representativeness:\n        *   **Randomization (Simple Random Sample - SRS):** Every unit has an equal chance of selection. \ud83d\udcd8\n        *   **Systematic Sampling:** Selecting subjects at regular intervals after a random start. \ud83d\udcd8\n        *   **Cluster Sampling:** Randomly selecting naturally occurring groups (clusters). \ud83d\udcd8\n        *   **Stratified Sampling:** Dividing the population into meaningful subgroups (strata) and sampling from each. \ud83d\udcd8\n\n*   **11.2 Sampling Distribution:**\n    *   **Concept:** Illustrates that if you take many samples from a population and calculate the mean of each sample, these sample means will form their own distribution, called a \"sampling distribution.\" \ud83d\udcd8\n    *   **Impact of Sample Size:** Demonstrates how increasing sample size makes the sampling distribution of sample means more closely clustered around the true population mean and more normally distributed. \ud83d\udcd8\n    *   **Standard Error:** Introduces the \"standard error\" as the standard deviation of a sampling distribution, indicating the variability of sample means. \ud83d\udcd8\n\n*   **11.3 Central Limit Theorem (CLT):**\n    *   **Key Theorem:** States that if samples of a sufficiently large size (generally n \u2265 30) are drawn from *any* population, the sampling distribution of the sample means will approximate a normal distribution. \ud83d\udcd8\n    *   **Mean and Standard Deviation of Sampling Distribution:** Provides formulas for the mean of the sample means (\u00b5x\u0304 = \u00b5, the population mean) and the standard error (sx\u0304 = s/\u221an, population standard deviation divided by the square root of sample size). \ud83d\udcd8\n    *   **Practical Use:** This theorem is crucial because it allows statisticians to use the properties of the normal distribution to make inferences about population means even when the original population distribution is unknown. \ud83d\udcd8\n\n*   **11.4 Confidence Intervals:**\n    *   **Estimation:** Introduces \"estimation\" as an inferential technique to estimate a population parameter (like the mean) from a sample. \ud83d\udcd8\n    *   **Point Estimate vs. Confidence Interval:** A sample mean is a \"point estimate\" (a single plausible value). A \"confidence interval\" is a range of plausible values for the population mean. \ud83d\udcd8\n    *   **Confidence Level:** Defines the \"confidence level\" (e.g., 95%) as the assurance that the interval will enclose the true population mean. It's the probability that the *method* used produces an interval containing the true mean, not that a specific interval contains it. \ud83d\udcd8\n    *   **Calculation:** Shows the formula for a confidence interval using a sample mean, Z-score (for the desired confidence level), and the standard error. It notes that for practical situations (when population standard deviation is unknown), a \"t-statistic\" will be used instead of Z. \ud83d\udcd8\n\n### Chapter 12: Hypothesis Testing \ud83d\udcd8\n\nBuilding on the concepts from Chapter 11, this chapter introduces the formal process of hypothesis testing to make decisions about population parameters.\n\n*   **12.1 Hypothesis Testing:**\n    *   **Purpose:** A statistical inference method for making decisions based on incomplete information by asking a question, collecting data, and examining what the data tells us. \ud83d\udcd8\n    *   **Null (H0) and Alternative (Ha) Hypotheses:** Explains that hypothesis tests always involve two statements: the null hypothesis (H0, status quo, no difference/effect) and the alternative hypothesis (Ha, what you believe or are trying to prove). \ud83d\udcd8\n    *   **One- and Two-Tailed Tests:** Differentiates between tests where the alternative hypothesis specifies a direction (one-tailed, e.g., > or <) versus those that simply state a difference (two-tailed, e.g., \u2260). \ud83d\udcd8\n    *   **Level of Significance (Alpha, \u03b1):** The predetermined probability (e.g., 0.05 or 0.01) that determines how improbable a sample mean must be to be considered \"significantly different\" from the hypothesized mean. \ud83d\udcd8\n    *   **Type I and Type II Errors:** Crucial concepts for understanding the risks in hypothesis testing:\n        *   **Type I Error (\u03b1):** Rejecting a true null hypothesis (false positive). The alpha level is the probability of making a Type I error. \ud83d\udcd8\n        *   **Type II Error (\u03b2):** Failing to reject a false null hypothesis (false negative). \ud83d\udcd8\n\n*   **12.2 Critical Values:**\n    *   **Definition:** \"Critical values\" are the boundaries that define the \"critical region\" (or \"rejection region\") in the sampling distribution. \ud83d\udcd8\n    *   **Critical Region:** The area under the distribution curve where, if the test statistic falls, the null hypothesis is rejected. \ud83d\udcd8\n    *   **Finding Critical Values:** Explains how critical values are determined based on the alpha level and whether the test is one-tailed or two-tailed (using Z-scores for known population standard deviation). \ud83d\udcd8\n\n*   **12.3 One-Sample T Test:**\n    *   **Steps of Hypothesis Testing:** Outlines a four-step process: 1) State hypotheses, 2) Select significance level and check assumptions, 3) Analyze data and compute test statistic, 4) Interpret result. \ud83d\udcd8\n    *   **Z-test vs. T-test:** Clarifies when to use each:\n        *   **Z-test:** Used when the population standard deviation is *known*. \ud83d\udcd8\n        *   **T-test:** Used when the population standard deviation is *unknown*, and the sample standard deviation is used as an estimate. This is the more common real-world scenario. \ud83d\udcd8\n    *   **Student's t-distribution:**\n        *   **Description:** A distribution similar to the normal distribution but wider and with thicker tails, especially for small sample sizes. \ud83d\udcd8\n        *   **Degrees of Freedom (df):** The shape of the t-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom (df = n - 1, where n is the sample size). As df increases, the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution. \ud83d\udcd8\n        *   **T-table:** A table used to find critical t-values based on degrees of freedom and alpha level. \ud83d\udcd8\n    *   **T-test Formula:** Provides the formula for the t-statistic: `t = (x\u0304 - \u00b50) / (s/\u221an)`, where \u00b50 is the hypothesized population mean, x\u0304 is the sample mean, s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size. \ud83d\udcd8\n    *   **P-values:** Introduces p-values as an alternative decision-making tool. If the p-value (probability of observing the sample data if H0 is true) is less than alpha, the null hypothesis is rejected. \ud83d\udcd8\n    *   **Estimation as Follow-up:** Explains that if the null hypothesis is rejected, constructing a confidence interval using the t-critical value is a useful follow-up to estimate the *actual* range of the population mean. \ud83d\udcd8\n\nIn essence, Chapter 11 teaches you *how to prepare and understand* the tools for making statistical inferences (sampling, avoiding bias, and the Central Limit Theorem), while Chapter 12 teaches you *how to use those tools* to formally test claims about populations (hypothesis testing with Z-tests and, more commonly, T-tests) and estimate parameters with confidence intervals based on sample data."}], "quiz_history": [{"question": "A city newspaper conducts an online poll to determine public opinion on a new city park project.

These may be decisions that are\nimportant to us such as, \"Will I improve my biology grades if I spend more time studying vocabulary?\" or \"Should\nI become a chemistry major to increase my chances of getting into med school?\" This section is about the use of\nhypothesis testing to help us with these decisions. Hypothesis testing is a kind of statistical inference that involves\nasking a question, collecting data, and then examining what the data tells us about how to procede.\nIn a formal hypothesis test, hypotheses are always statements about the population. The hypothesis tests we will\nexamine in this chapter involve statements about the average values (means) of some variable in the population. For\nexample, we may want to know if the average time that college freshmen spend studying each week is really 20\nhours per week. We may want to compare this average time spent studying for freshmen that earned a GPA of 3.0\nor higher and those that did not. In later chapters, we will be able to test if the average time studying differs for four\ngroups: freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors.\nDeveloping Null and Alternative Hypotheses\nIn statistical hypothesis testing, there are always two hypotheses. The hypothesis to be tested is called the null\nhypothesis and given the symbol H0. The null hypothesis states that there is no difference between a hypothesized\npopulation mean and a sample mean. It is the status quo hypothesis.\nFor example, if we were to test the hypothesis that college freshmen study 20 hours per week, we would express our\nnull hypothesis as:\nH0:\u00b5=20\nWe test the null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis, which is given the symbol Ha. The alternative\nhypothesis is often the hypothesis that you believe yourself! It includes the outcomes not covered by the null\nhypothesis. In this example, our alternative hypothesis would express that freshmen do not study 20 hours per week:\nHa:\u00b56=20\nExample A\nWe have a medicine that is being manufactured and each pill is supposed to have 14 milligrams of the active\ningredient. What are our null and alternative hypotheses?\n248\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 12. Hypothesis Testing\nSolution\nH0:\u00b5=14\nHa:\u00b56=14\nOur null hypothesis states that the population has a mean equal to 14 milligrams. Our alternative hypothesis states\nthat the population has a mean that is different than 14 milligrams.\nExample B\nThe school principal wants to test if it is true what teachers say \u2013 that high school juniors use the computer an average\n3.2 hours a day. What are our null and alternative hypotheses?\nSolution\nH0:\u00b5=3:2\nHa:\u00b56=3:2\nOur null hypothesis states that the population has a mean equal to 3.2 hours. Our alternative hypothesis states that\nthe population has a mean that differs from 3.2 hours.\nDeciding Whether to Reject the Null Hypothesis: One and Two-Tailed Hypothesis Tests\nThe alternative hypothesis can be supported only by rejecting the null hypothesis. To reject the null hypothesis\nmeans to \ufb01nd a large enough difference between your sample mean and the hypothesized (null) mean that it raises\nreal doubt that the true population mean is 20. If the difference between the hypothesized mean and the sample mean\nis very large, we reject the null hypothesis. If the difference is very small, we do not. In each hypothesis test, we\nhave to decide in advance what the magnitude of that difference must be to allow us to reject the null hypothesis.\nBelow is an overview of this process. Notice that if we fail to \ufb01nd a large enough difference to reject, we fail to\nreject the null hypothesis. Those are your only two alternatives.\nWhen a hypothesis is tested, a statistician must decide on how much of a difference between means is necessary in\norder to reject the null hypothesis.\nStatisticians \ufb01rst choose a level of signi\ufb01cance oralpha (a)level for their hypothesis test. Similar to the signi\ufb01cance\nlevel you used in constructing con\ufb01dence intervals, this alpha level tells us how improbable a sample mean must\nbe for it to be deemed \"signi\ufb01cantly different\" from the hypothesized mean. The most frequently used levels of\nsigni\ufb01cance are 0 :05 and 0 :01:An alpha level of 0.05 means that we will consider our sample mean to be signi\ufb01cantly\ndifferent from the hypothesized mean if the chances of observing that sample mean are less than 5%. Similarly, an\nalpha level of 0.01 means that we will consider our sample mean to be signi\ufb01cantly differnet from the hypothesized\nmean if the chances of observing that sample mean are less than 1%.\n249\n12.1. Hypothesis Testing www.ck12.org\nTwo-tailed Hypothesis Tests\nA hypothesis test can be one-tailed or two-tailed. The examples above are all two-tailed hypothesis tests. We indicate\nthat the average study time is either 20 hours per week, or it is not. Computer use averages 3.2 hours per week, or\nit does not. We do not specify whether we believe the true mean to be higher or lower than the hypothesized mean.\nWe just believe it must be different.\nIn a two-tailed test, you will reject the null hypothesis if your sample mean falls in either tail of the distribution. For\nthis reason, the alpha level (let\u2019s assume .05) is split across the two tails. The curve below shows the critical regions\nfor a two-tailed test. These are the regions under the normal curve that, together, sum to a probability of 0.05. Each\ntail has a probability of 0.025. The z-scores that designate the start of the critical region are called the critical values\n.\nIf the sample mean taken from the population falls within these critical regions, or \"rejection regions,\" we would\nconclude that there was too much of a difference and we would reject the null hypothesis. However, if the mean\nfrom the sample falls in the middle of the distribution (in between the critical regions) we would fail to reject the\nnull hypothesis.\nFIGURE 12.1\nOne-Tailed Hypothesis Test\nWe would use a single-tail hypothesis test when the direction of the results is anticipated or we are only interested in\none direction of the results. For example, a single-tail hypothesis test may be used when evaluating whether or not\nto adopt a new textbook. We would only decide to adopt the textbook if it improved student achievement relative to\nthe old textbook.\nWhen performing a single-tail hypothesis test, our alternative hypothesis looks a bit different. We use the symbols of\ngreater than or less than. For example, let\u2019s say we were claiming that the average SAT score of graduating seniors\nwas GREATER than 1,110. Remember, our own personal hypothesis is the alternative hypothesis. Then our null\nand alternative hypothesis could look something like:\nH0:\u00b5\u00141100\nHa:\u00b5>1100\nIn this scenario, our null hypothesis states that the mean SAT scores would be less than or equal to 1,100 while the\nalternate hypothesis states that the SAT scores would be greater than 1,100. A single-tail hypothesis test also means\n250\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 12. Hypothesis Testing\nthat we have only one critical region because we put the entire critical region into just one side of the distribution.\nWhen the alternative hypothesis is that the sample mean is greater, the critical region is on the right side of the\ndistribution (see below). When the alternative hypothesis is that the sample is smaller, the critical region is on the\nleft side of the distribution.\nFIGURE 12.2\nTo calculate the critical regions, we must \ufb01rst \ufb01nd the critical values or the cut-offs where the critical regions start.\nThis will be covered in the next section.\nType I and Type II Errors\nRemember that there will be some sample means that are extremes \u2013 that is going to happen about 5% of the time,\nsince 95% of all sample means fall within about two standard deviations of the mean. What happens if we run a\nhypothesis test and we get an extreme sample mean? It won\u2019t look like our hypothesized mean, even if it comes\nfrom that distribution. We would be likely to reject the null hypothesis. But we would be wrong.\nWhen we decide to reject or not reject the null hypothesis, we have four possible scenarios:\na. A true hypothesis is rejected.\nb. A true hypothesis is not rejected.\nc. A false hypothesis is not rejected.\nd. A false hypothesis is rejected.\nIf a hypothesis is true and we do not reject it (Option 2) or if a false hypothesis is rejected (Option 4), we have made\nthe correct decision. But if we reject a true hypothesis (Option 1) or a false hypothesis is not rejected (Option 3) we\nhave made an error. Overall, one type of error is not necessarily more serious than the other. Which type is more\nserious depends on the speci\ufb01c research situation, but ideally both types of errors should be minimized during the\nanalysis.\n251\n12.1. Hypothesis Testing www.ck12.org\nTABLE 12.1: The Four Possible Outcomes in Hypothesis Testing\nDecision Made Null Hypothesis is True Null Hypothesis is False\nReject Null Hypothesis Type I Error Correct Decision\nDo not Reject Null Hypothesis Correct Decision Type II Error\nThe general approach to hypothesis testing focuses on the Type I error: rejecting the null hypothesis when it may\nbe true. Guess what? The level of signi\ufb01cance, also known as the alpha level, ISthe probability of making a Type\nI error. At the 0 :05 level, the decision to reject the hypothesis may be incorrect 5% of the time. Calculating the\nprobability of making a Type II error is not as straightforward as calculating a Type I error, and we won\u2019t discuss\nthat here.\nYou should be able to recognize what each type of error looks like in a particular hypothesis test. For example,\nsuppose you are are testing whether listening to rock music helps you improve your memory of 30 random objects.\nAssume further that it doesn\u2019t. A Type I error would be concluding that listenting to rock music didhelp memory\n(but you are wrong). A Type I error will only occur when your null hypothesis is false. Let\u2019s assume that listening\nto rock music does improve memory. In this scenario, if you concluded that it didn\u2019t, you would be wrong again.\nBut this time you would be making a Type II error \u2014 failing to \ufb01nd a signi\ufb01cant difference when one in fact exists.\nIt is also important that you realize that the chance of making a Type I error is under our direct control. Often we\nestablish the alpha level based on the severity of the consequences of making a Type I error. If the consequences are\nnot that serious, we could set an alpha level at 0 :10 or 0 :20:In other words, we are comfortable making a decision\nwhere we could falsely reject the null hypothesis 10 to 20% of the time. However, in a \ufb01eld like medical research,\nwe would set the alpha level very low (at 0 :001 for example) if there was potential bodily harm to patients.\nLesson Summary\na. Hypothesis testing involves making educated guesses about a population based on a sample drawn from the\npopulation. We generate null and alternative hypotheses based on the mean of the population to test these\nguesses.\nb. We establish critical regions based on level of signi\ufb01cance or alpha (a)levels. If the value of the test statistic\nfalls in these critical regions, we are able to reject it.\nc. When we make a decision about a hypothesis, there are four different outcome and possibilities and two\ndifferent types of errors. A Type I error is when we reject the null hypothesis when it is true and a Type II\nerror is when we do not reject the null hypothesis, even when it is false.\nReview Questions\n1. If the difference between the hypothesized population mean and the mean of the sample is large, we ___ the\nnull hypothesis. If the difference between the hypothesized population mean and the mean of the sample is\nsmall, we ___ the null hypothesis.\n2. At the Chrysler manufacturing plant, there is a part that is supposed to weigh precisely 19 pounds. The\nengineers take a sample of parts and want to know if they meet the weight speci\ufb01cations. What are our\nnull and alternative hypotheses?\n3. In a hypothesis test, if difference between the sample mean and the hypothesized mean divided by the standard\nerror falls in the middle of the distribution and in between the critical values, we ___ the null hypothesis. If\nthis number falls in the critical regions and beyond the critical values, we ___ the null hypothesis.\n4. Sacramento County high school seniors have an average SAT score of 1,020.

Critical Values www.ck12.org\n12.2 Critical Values\nLearning Objective\n\u2022 Understand the relationship between the critical value and the critical region.\n\u2022 To accurately identify the critical region for a one- or two-tailed test.\n\u2022 To locate the critical value for a given signi\ufb01cance level.\nCritical Values\nCritical values are the values that indicate the edge of the critical region. Critical regions describe the entire area\nof values that indicate you reject the null hypothesis. In other words, the critical region is the area encompassed by\nthe values notincluded in the initial claim - the area of the \u2019tails\u2019 of the distribution.\nThe \u201ctails\u201d of a test are the values outside of the critical values . In other words, the tails are the ends of the\ndistribution, and they begin at the greatest or least value included in the alternative hypothesis (the critical values).\nIn the graph below, the tails are in red and the rest of the distribution is in green. The critical values of the test in\nthe image are -8 and 28, as these are the dividers between values supporting the alternative and null hypothesis. The\narea in red can also be seen as the rejection region , since an observed value in this region indicates that the null\nhypothesis should be rejected.\nHypothesis Tests and Their Tails\nThere are three types of test from a \u201ctails\u201d standpoint:\n\u2022 Aleft-tailed test only has a tail on the left side of the graph:\n\u2022 Aright-tailed test only has a tail on the right side of the graph:\n254\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 12. Hypothesis Testing\n\u2022 Atwo-tailed test has tails on both ends of the graph. This is a test where the null hypothesis is a claim of a\nspeci\ufb01c value. For example: H0:X=5\nExample A\nA researcher claims that black horses are, on average, more than 30 lbs heavier than white horses, which average\n1100 lbs. What is the null hypothesis, and what kind of test is this?\nSolution\nThe null hypothesis would be notated H0:\u00b5\u00141130 lbs\nThis is a right-tailed test, since the tail of the graph would be on the right. Recognize that values above 1130 would\nindicate that the null hypothesis be rejected, and the red area represents the rejection region .\nExample B\nA package of gum claims that the \ufb02avor lasts more than 39 minutes. What would be the null hypothesis of a test to\ndetermine the validity of the claim? What sort of test is this?\nSolution\nThe null hypothesis would by notated as H0:\u00b5\u001439.\nThis is a right-tailed test, since the rejection region would consist of values greater than 39.\nExample C\nAn ice pack claims to stay cold between 35 and 65 minutes. What would be the null hypothesis of a test to determine\nthe validity of the claim? What sort of test would it be?\nSolution\nThe null hypothesis would be H0: 35>\u00b5[\u00b5>65.\nThis is a two-tailed test, since the null hypothesis contains the values above and below a given range.\n255\n12.2. Critical Values www.ck12.org\nLocating a Critical Value\nIn this lesson, we will use a table to \ufb01nd critical values. For the moment, we will be dealing only with the Z-score\ncritical values of a normal distribution. (NOTE: The z-table is an appropriate resource for conducting tests when\nwe know what the parameters are of our population. However, we will turn to a new table when we discuss how to\nconduct your typical hypothesis test with a sample.)\nExample D\nWhat is the critical value\u0010\nZa\nz\u0011\nfor a 95% con\ufb01dence level, assuming a two-tailed test?\nSolution\nA 95% con\ufb01dence level means that a total of 5% of the area under the curve is considered the critical region.\nSince this is a two-tailed test,1\n2of 5% = 2.5% of the values would be in the left tail, and the other 2.5% would be in\nthe right tail. Looking up the Z-score associated with 0.025 on a reference table, we \ufb01nd 1.96. Therefore, +1.96 is\nthe critical value of the right tail and -1.96 is the critical value of the left tail.\nThe critical value for a 95% con\ufb01dence level is Z= +=\u00001:96.\nExample E\nSketch the Z-score critical region for Example D.\nSolution\nSketch the graph of the normal distribution with the given values and mark the critical values from Example D, then\nshade the area from the critical values away from the center. The shaded areas are the critical regions.\n256\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 12. Hypothesis Testing\nExample F\nWhat would be the critical value for a right-tailed test with a=0:01?\nSolution\nIfa=0:01, then the area under the curve representing H1, the alternative hypothesis, would be 99%, since a(alpha)\nis the same as the area of the rejection region. Using the Z-score reference table above, we \ufb01nd that the Z-score\nassociated with 0.9900 is approximately 2.33.\nIt appears that the critical value is Z=2:33.\nLet\u2019s see if that answer makes sense. Since this is a right-tailed test, ais on the right end of the graph, and 1 \u0000ais\non the left. A Z-score of +2.33 is well to the right of the center of the graph, and describes the area under the curve\nfrom that point to the left, nearly the entire graph. Since the initial question speci\ufb01ed a=0:01, indicating that only\n1% of the area is in the critical region, Z= +2:33 is quite reasonable.\nVocabulary\nCritical values are values separating the values that support or reject the null hypothesis.\nCritical regions are the areas under the distribution curve representing values that support the null hypothesis.\nGuided Practice\n1. What would be the critical value for a left-tailed test with a=0:01?\n2. What would be the critical region for a two-tailed test with a=0:08?\n3. What would be the afor a right-tailed test with a critical value of Z=1:76?\nSolutions\n1. A left-tailed test with a=0:01 would have 99% of the area under the curve outside of the critical region. If\nwe use a reference to \ufb01nd the Z-score for 0.99, we get approximately 2.33. However, a Z-score of 2.33 is\nsigni\ufb01cantly to the right of the center of the distribution, including all the area to the left and only leaving a\nvery small alpha value on the right. While we are indeed looking for a critical value with only a very small\nalpha, this is a left-tailed test, so the critical value we need is negative . The solution is z = -2.33.\n2. We are looking for the critical region here, but let\u2019s start by \ufb01nding the critical values. This is a two-tailed\ntest, so half of the alpha will be in the left tail, and half in the right. That means that we are looking for\na positive/negative critical value associated with an alpha of 0.04, which indicates that we need to \ufb01nd the\n257\n12.2. Critical Values www.ck12.org\nZ-score for (1\u00000:04) =0:96. Referring to the Z-score table, we see that 0.96 corresponds to approximately\n1.75. The critical values, then are +/- 1.75, and the critical region would be Z<\u00001:75[Z>1:75.\n3. The area under the curve associated with a Z-score of 1.76, according to the reference table above, is 0.9608.\nSince 96.08% of the area is to the left of Z=1:76, that leaves approximately 1 \u00000:9608 =0:0392 as the area\nin the critical region. The solution is alpha = 0.0392.\nAdditional Guided Practice\nFor each question:\na) State the null and alternative hypothesis for a test to determine the validity of the claim\nb) Identify left, right, or two-tailed test type\n1.

(a) H1:\u00b5>35lbsandH0: 35lbs\u0015\u00b5\n(b) This is a right-tailed test, since the rejection region is located on the right end of the graph.\n2. (a) H1:\u00b5<5days andH0:\u00b5\u00155days\n(b) This is a left-tailed test, since the \u2019reject\u2019 values are on the left end of the graph.\nMore Practice\nFor each question:\na) State the null and alternative hypothesis for a test to determine the validity of the claim\nb) Identify left, right, or two-tailed test type\n1.

Previously, we inferred about a population by\ncalculating a con\ufb01dence interval. We estimated the true mean of a population from a sample mean and created\nacon\ufb01dence interval provided a margin of error for our estimate. In this chapter, we also use sample data to help us\nmake decisions about what is true about a population.\nWhen conducting a hypothesis test, we are asking ourselves whether the information in the sample is consistent ,or\ninconsistent , with the null hypothesis about the population. We follow a series of four basic steps:\n1. State the null and alternative hypotheses.\n2. Select the appropriate signi\ufb01cance level and check the test assumptions.\n3. Analyze the data and compute the test statistic.\n4. Interpret the result\nIf we reject the null hypothesis we are saying that the difference between the observed sample mean and the\nhypothesized population mean is too great to be attributed to chance. When we fail to reject the null hypothesis, we\nare saying that the difference between the observed sample mean and the hypothesized population mean is probable\nif the null hypothesis is true. Essentially, we are willing to attribute this difference to sampling error.\nConducting a Hypothesis Test on One Sample Mean When the Population Parameters are Known\nAlthough this is rarely the case, we can use our familiar z-statistic to conduct a hypothesis test on a single sample\nmean. In short, we \ufb01nd the z-statistic of our sample mean in the sampling distribution and determine if that z-score\nfalls within the critical (rejection) region or not. This test is only appropriate when you know the true mean and\nstandard deviation of the population.\nExample A\nThe school nurse thinks the average height of 7th graders has increased. The average height of a 7th grader \ufb01ve years\nago was 145 cm with a standard deviation of 20 cm. She takes a random sample of 200 students and \ufb01nds that the\naverage height of her sample is 147 cm. Are 7th graders now taller than they were before? Conduct a single-tailed\nhypothesis test using a .05 signi\ufb01cance level to evaluate the null and alternative hypotheses.\nFirst, we develop our null and alternative hypotheses:\n260\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 12. Hypothesis Testing\nH0:\u00b5\u0014145\nHa:\u00b5>145\nChoose a=:05. The critical value for this one tailed test is z=1.64. This is a one-tailed test, and a z-score of 1.64\ncuts off 5% in the single tail. Any test statistic greater than 1.64 will be in the rejection region.\nNext, we calculate the test statistic for the sample of 7thgraders.\nz=147\u0000145\n20p\n200\u00191:414\nThe calculated z\u0000score of 1.414 is smaller than 1.64 and thus does not fall in the critical region. Our decision is to\nfail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the probability of obtaining a sample mean equal to 147 is likely\nto have been due to chance.\nExample B\nA farmer is trying out a planting technique that he hopes will increase the yield on his pea plants. The average\nnumber of pods on one of his pea plants is 145 pods with a standard deviation of 100 pods. This year, after trying\nhis new planting technique, he takes a random sample of his plants and \ufb01nds the average number of pods to be 147.\nHe wonders whether or not this is a statistically signi\ufb01cant increase. What are his hypotheses and the test statistic?\n1. First, we develop our null and alternative hypotheses:\nH0:\u00b5\u0014145\nHa:\u00b5>145\nThis alternative hypothesis is >since he believes that there might be a gain in the number of pods.\n2. Next, we calculate the test statistic for the sample of pea plants.\nz=(\u00afx\u0000\u00b5)\nspn=(147\u0000145)\n100p\n144\u00190:24\n3. If we choose a=:05\n4. The critical value will be 1.645. We will reject the null hypothesis if the test statistic is greater than 1.645.\nThe value of the test statistic is 0.24.\n5. This is less than 1.645 and so our decision is to fail to reject H0.\n6. Based on our sample we believe the mean is equal to 145.\nReporting P-Values as an Alternative to Looking at Critical Regions\nWe can also evaluate a hypothesis by asking, \u201cWhat is the probability of obtaining the value of the test statistic we\ndid if the null hypothesis is true?\u201d This is called the p\u0000value.\n261\n12.3. One-Sample T Test www.ck12.org\nExample C\nLet\u2019s use the example about the pea farmer. As we mentioned, the farmer is wondering if the number of pea pods\nper plant has gone up with his new planting technique and \ufb01nds that out of a sample of 144 peas there is an average\nnumber of 147 pods per plant (compared to a previous average of 145 pods). To determine the p\u0000value we ask\nwhat is P(z> :24)? That is, what is the probability of obtaining a zvalue greater than .24 is the null hypothesis is\ntrue? Using technology, we \ufb01nd this probability to be .49. This indicates that there is a 49% chance that under the\nnull hypothesis the peas will produce more than 145 pods. Alternatively, we can just indicate that p >.05. Since we\nset alpha at .05, we won\u2019t reject if the probability of observing that sample mean is >.05.\nWhen you use technology to conduct a hypothesis test, as in lab, you will receive a p-value as part of your\noutput. The p-values is the likelihood of observing that particuluar sample value if the null hypothesis were true .\nTherefore, if the p-value is smaller than your signi\ufb01cance level, you can reject the null hypothesis.\nHypothesis Tests When You Don\u2019t Know Your Population Parameters\nA z-test makes for an easy hypothesis test, but most of the time we can\u2019t use it. The reality is that most of our\nanalyses are done when we don\u2019t know what is true about a population. We don\u2019t know the true population mean,\nand we certainly don\u2019t know the true population standard deviation. Instead, we want to conduct a hypothesis test\nusing only our sample and the information it can provide us. How can we do this?\nHow We Learned to Test Hypotheses on Samples, without Knowledge of the Population\nBack in the early 1900\u2019s, a chemist at a brewery in Ireland discovered that when he was working with very small\nsamples, the distributions of the mean differed signi\ufb01cantly from the normal distribution. He noticed that as his\nsample sizes changed, the shape of the distribution changed as well. He published his results under the pseudonym\n\u2019Student\u2019 and this concept and the distributions for small sample sizes are now known as \u201cStudent\u2019s t\u0000distributions.\u201d\nThe Student\u2019s t-distribution is similar to the normal distribution, except it is more spread out and wider in appear-\nance, and has thicker tails. As the number of observations gets larger, the t-distribution shape becomes more and\nmore like the shape of the normal distribution. In fact, if we had an in\ufb01nite number of observations, the t distribution\nwould perfectly match the normal distribution. It is the t-distribution that allows us to test hypotheses when we don\u2019t\nknow the true population standard deviation, as we\u2019ll see below.\nFIGURE 12.3\nThe differences between the t-distribution and the normal distribution are more exaggerated when there are fewer\ndata points, and therefore fewer degrees of freedom . Degrees of freedom are essentially the number of samples\nthat have the \u2019freedom\u2019 to change without affecting the sample mean. A clear description of degrees of freedom is\nbeyond the scope of this lesson, but you can \ufb01nd many online lessons describing them if you are interested. For our\n262\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 12. Hypothesis Testing\npurposes, all you really need to know about degrees of freedom is that there is always one less degree of freedom\nthan the number of data points:\nd f=n\u00001\nThe reason you need to know how to \ufb01nd the number of degrees of freedom is quite simple: when you use a t-\ndistribution for a hypothesis test, there is a different critical value for each number of degrees of freedom. The larger\nyour sample, the closer the critical value gets to the z-score for your alpha level. Below is the t-table. It shows you\nthe critical value for the selected alpha level (across the top) for the degrees of freedom of your test. If you were\nconducting a two-tailed hypothesis test on a sample of 25 students, your df = 24 and your critical value at a=0.05 is\n\u00062.064 because there is 0.025 in each tail.\nConditions for Using T-Test\nThe t\u0000distribution can be used with any statistic having a bell-shaped distribution. The Central Limit Theorem\nstates the sampling distribution of a statistic will be close to normal with a large enough sample size. As a rough\nestimate, the Central Limit Theorem predicts a roughly normal distribution under any of the following conditions:\n\u2022 The population distribution is normal; or\n\u2022 The sampling distribution is symmetric and the sample size is \u001415;\u2019 or\n\u2022 The sampling distribution is moderately skewed and the sample size is 16 \u0014n\u001430; or\n\u2022 The sample size is greater than 30, without outliers.\nT Table\nTABLE 12.3: Upper-Tail Probability\nDF 0.25 0.20 0.15 0.10 0.05 0.025 0.01 0.005 0.001\n1 1.000 1.376 1.963 3.078 6.314 12.710 31.820 63.660 318.300\n2 0.816 1.061 1.386 1.886 2.920 4.303 6.965 9.925 22.330\n3 0.765 0.978 1.250 1.638 2.353 3.182 4.541 5.841 10.210\n4 0.741 0.941 1.190 1.533 2.132 2.776 3.747 4.604 7.173\n5 0.727 0.920 1.156 1.476 2.015 2.571 3.365 4.032 5.893\n6 0.718 0.906 1.134 1.440 1.943 2.447 3.143 3.707 5.208\n7 0.711 0.896 1.119 1.415 1.895 2.365 2.998 3.499 4.785\n8 0.706 0.889 1.108 1.397 1.860 2.306 2.896 3.355 4.501\n9 0.703 0.883 1.100 1.383 1.833 2.262 2.821 3.250 4.297\n10 0.700 0.879 1.093 1.372 1.812 2.228 2.764 3.169 4.144\n11 0.697 0.876 1.088 1.363 1.796 2.201 2.718 3.106 4.025\n12 0.695 0.873 1.083 1.356 1.782 2.179 2.681 3.055 3.930\n13 0.694 0.870 1.079 1.350 1.771 2.160 2.650 3.012 3.852\n14 0.692 0.868 1.076 1.345 1.761 2.145 2.624 2.977 3.787\n15 0.691 0.866 1.074 1.341 1.753 2.131 2.602 2.947 3.733\n16 0.690 0.865 1.071 1.337 1.746 2.120 2.583 2.921 3.686\n17 0.689 0.863 1.069 1.333 1.740 2.110 2.567 2.898 3.646\n18 0.688 0.862 1.067 1.330 1.734 2.101 2.552 2.878 3.610\n19 0.688 0.861 1.066 1.328 1.729 2.093 2.539 2.861 3.579\n20 0.687 0.860 1.064 1.325 1.725 2.086 2.528 2.845 3.552\n21 0.686 0.859 1.063 1.323 1.721 2.080 2.518 2.831 3.527\n263\n12.3.

It\u2019s simple: When we know the\npopulation standard deviation we use the normal distribution. When we don\u2019t know the population standard deviation\n(so we need to use our sample standard deviation), we use the t-distribution.\nWe use the Student\u2019s t\u0000distribution in hypothesis testing the same way that we use the normal distribution. Each\nrow in the tdistribution table (see above) represents a different t\u0000distribution. Each distribution is associated with\na unique number of degrees of freedom (the number of observations minus one).

Hypothesis Testing\nExample D\nThe high school athletic director is asked if football players are doing as well academically as the other student\nathletes. We know from a previous study that the average GPA for the student athletes is 3.10. After an initiative to\nhelp improve the GPA of student athletes, the athletic director randomly samples 20 football players and \ufb01nds that\nthe average GPA of the sample is 3.18 with a sample standard deviation of 0.54. Is there a signi\ufb01cant improvement?\nUse a 0.05 signi\ufb01cance level.\n\u2022Hypothesis Step 1: Cleary state the null and alternative hypotheses.\nH0:\u00b5=3:10\nHa:\u00b56=3:10\n\u2022Hypothesis Step 2: Identify the appropriate signi\ufb01cance level and con\ufb01rm the test assumptions.\nWe were told that we should use a 0.05 signi\ufb01cance level. We assume that each football player is indepen-\ndently tested \u2013that their GPA is not related to another football player\u2019s GPA. Without the data, we have to\nassume that the sample is nearly normal (the sample is an indication of the population shape). The size of the\nsample also helps here, as we have 20 players. So, we can conclude that the assumptions for the single sample\nt-test have been met.\n\u2022Hypothesis Step 3 : Analyze the data\nWe use our t-test formula:\nt=\u00afx\u0000\u00b50\nspn=3:18\u00003:10\n0:54p\n20=0:66\nWe know that we have 20 observations, so our degrees of freedom for this test is 19. Nineteen degrees of\nfreedom at the 0.05 signi\ufb01cance level gives us a critical value of \u00062.093.\n\u2022Hypothesis Step 4 : Interpret your results\nSince our calculated t-test value is lower than our t-critical value, we fail to reject the Null Hypothesis.\nTherefore, the average GPA of the sample of football players is not signi\ufb01cantly different from the average\nGPA of student athletes. Therefore, we can conclude that the difference between the sample mean and the\nhypothesized value is not suf\ufb01cient to attribute it to anything other than sampling error. Thus, the athletic\ndirector can conclude that the mean academic performance of football players does not differ from the mean\nperformance of other student athletes.\nExample E\nDuracell manufactures batteries that the CEO claims will last an average of 300 hours under normal use.

The average battery life of the sample is signi\ufb01cantly different from the average battery life\nclaim by the CEO.\n266\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 12. Hypothesis Testing\nEstimation as a follow-up to a Hypothesis Test\nWhen a hypothesis is rejected, it is often useful to turn to estimation to try to capture the true value of the population\nmean. Now that we have rejected the claim that the average lifetime of a battery is 300 hours, we want to know how\nlong these batteries dolast. Let\u2019s take a look at how we can use estimation to answer this question.\nWe will choose a 95% con\ufb01dence interval. This is essentially the same degree of con\ufb01dence that we had in our\nt-test, since con\ufb01dence = 1 - a. To calculate the con\ufb01dence interval, we need to know three things: the mean of our\nsample, the standard error, and the critical value. The formula for the con\ufb01dence interval is:\n\u00afx\u0006Margin of Error\nWhere the Margin of Error is de\ufb01ned as:\nME=t-critical\u0001SE\u00afx\nNote that was are using the t-critical value (rather than z) because we are working only with sample data. We do not\nknow the true population mean or standard deviation. We have to use both our sample mean and our sample standard\nerror to create the con\ufb01dence interval.\nSo, for our above Durablast example, the Margin of Error would be (remember we have 19 degrees of freedom):\nME=2:093\u000111:18=23:40\nTherefore, our 95% con\ufb01dence interval is from (270 \u201323.40) to (270 + 23.40). That interval of (246.6, 293.4) shows\nus something: the con\ufb01dence interval for the population mean does notinclude 300. This is what we would expect,\nsince we rejected the null hypothesis in our earlier hypothesis test.\nThe visual representation of this con\ufb01dence interval would be:\nFIGURE 12.5\nThe central dot is the mean value of the sample (270 hours), with the left and right whiskers representing the lower\n267\n12.3. One-Sample T Test www.ck12.org\nand upper values of the 95% con\ufb01dence interval.\nIf we were to interpret the 95% con\ufb01dence interval we would say: \u201cI am 95% con\ufb01dent that the true population\nmean of Durablast battery lifespan is between 246.6 and 293.4 hours.\u201d\nExample F\nYou have just taken ownership of a pizza shop. The previous owner told you that you would save money if you\nbought the mozzarella cheese in a 4.5 pound slab. Each time you purchase a slab of cheese, you weigh it to ensure\nthat you are receiving 72 ounces of cheese. The results of 7 random measurements are 70, 69, 73, 68, 71, 69 and 71\nounces.

The test can only be\nconducted if the random sample taken from the population came from a distribution that is normal or approximately\nnormal. When you use sto estimate s, you must use tinstead of zto complete the signi\ufb01cance test for a mean.\nMore Practice\n1. In hypothesis testing, when we know the population standard deviation it is appropriate to use the _____-\ndistribution. When we do not know the population standard deviation, we should use the _____ distribution\n2. True or False: When we fail to reject the null hypothesis, we are saying that the difference between the\nobserved sample mean and the hypothesized population mean is probable if the null hypothesis is true.\n3.

Sampling Distributions and Estimation\n11.1 Surveys and Sampling\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Differentiate between a census and a survey or sample.\n\u2022 Distinguish between sampling error and bias.\n\u2022 Identify and name potential sources of bias from both real and hypothetical sampling situations.\nCensus vs. Sample\nAsample is a representative subset of a population. If a statistician or other researcher wants to know some\ninformation about a population, the only way to be truly sure is to conduct a census. In a census , every unit in\nthe population being studied is measured or surveyed. If we really wanted to know the true approval rating of the\npresident, for example, we would have to ask every single American adult his or her opinion. There are some obvious\nreasons why a census is impractical in this case, and in most situations.\nWhy is this impractical? First, it would be extremely expensive for the polling organization. They would need an\nextremely large workforce to try and collect the opinions of every American adult. Also, it would take many workers\nand many hours to organize, interpret, and display this information. Even if it could be done in several months, by\nthe time the results were published, it would be very probable that recent events had changed peoples\u2019 opinions and\nthat the results would be obsolete.\nIn addition, a census has the potential to be destructive to the population being studied. For example, many\nmanufacturing companies test their products for quality control. A padlock manufacturer might use a machine\nto see how much force it can apply to the lock before it breaks. If they did this with every lock, they would have\nnone left to sell! Likewise, it would not be a good idea for a biologist to \ufb01nd the number of \ufb01sh in a lake by draining\nthe lake and counting them all!\nSampling and Its Risks\nDue to all of the dif\ufb01culties associated with a census, sampling is much more practical. However, it is important\nto understand that even the most carefully planned sample will be subject to random variation between the sample\nand the population. Recall that these differences due to chance are called sampling error . Opinion polls, like the\nNew York Times poll mentioned in the introduction, tend to refer to this as margin of error . You will learn how to\ncalculate sampling error, or the margin of error, associated with samples in the next section.\nThe second statement quoted from the New York Times article mentions another problem with sampling. That is, it\nis often dif\ufb01cult to obtain a sample that accurately re\ufb02ects the total population. It is also possible to make mistakes\nin selecting the sample and collecting the information. These problems result in a non-representative sample, or one\nin which our conclusions differ from what they would have been if we had been able to conduct a census.\nBias in Samples and Surveys\nThe term most frequently applied to a non-representative sample is bias. Bias has many potential sources. It is\nimportant when selecting a sample or designing a survey that a statistician make every effort to eliminate potential\nsources of bias. In this section, we will discuss some of the most common types of bias. While these concepts are\nuniversal, the terms used to de\ufb01ne them here may be different than those used in other sources.\n223\n11.1. Surveys and Sampling www.ck12.org\nSampling Bias\nIn general, sampling bias refers to the methods used in selecting the sample. The sampling frame is the term we\nuse to refer to the group or listing from which the sample is to be chosen. If you wanted to study the population of\nstudents in your school, you could obtain a list of all the students from the of\ufb01ce and choose students from the list.\nThis list would be the sampling frame.\nIncorrect Sampling Frame\nIf the list from which you choose your sample does not accurately re\ufb02ect the characteristics of the population, this\nis called incorrect sampling frame . A sampling frame error occurs when some group from the population does not\nhave the opportunity to be represented in the sample. For example, surveys are often done over the telephone. You\ncould use the telephone book as a sampling frame by choosing numbers from the telephone book. However,some\nphone numbers are not listed in the telephone book. In addition, younger adults in particular tend to only use their\ncell phones or computer-based phone services and may not even have traditional phone service. Even if you picked\nphone numbers randomly, the sampling frame could be incorrect, because there are also people, especially those\nwho may be economically disadvantaged, who have no phone. There is absolutely no chance for these individuals\nto be represented in your sample. A term often used to describe the problems when a group of the population is not\nrepresented in a survey is undercoverage . Undercoverage can result from all of the different sampling biases.\nYou may have heard of one of the most famous examples of sampling frame error. It occurred during the 1936 U.S.\npresidential election. The Literary Digest , a popular magazine at the time, conducted a poll and predicted that Alf\nLandon would win the election. As it turned out, the election was won in a landslide by Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\nThe magazine obtained a huge sample of ten million people, and from that pool, 2 million replied. With these\nnumbers, you would typically expect very accurate results. However, the magazine used their subscription list as\ntheir sampling frame. During the depression, these individuals would have been only the wealthiest Americans, who\ntended to vote Republican, and left the majority of typical voters under-covered.\nConvenience Sampling\nSuppose your statistics teacher gave you an assignment to perform a survey of 20 individuals. You would most\nlikely tend to ask your friends and family to participate, because it would be easy and quick. This is an example of\nconvenience sampling , or convenience bias. While it is not always true, your friends are usually people who share\ncommon values, interests, and opinions. This could cause those opinions to be over-represented in relation to the\ntrue population. Also, have you ever been approached by someone conducting a survey on the street or in a mall?\nIf such a person were just to ask the \ufb01rst 20 people they found, there is the potential that large groups representing\nvarious opinions would not be included, resulting in undercoverage.\nJudgment Sampling\nJudgment sampling occurs when an individual or organization that is usually considered an expert in the \ufb01eld\nbeing studied chooses the individuals or group of individuals to be used in the sample. Because it is based on a\nsubjective choice, even by someone considered an expert, it is very susceptible to bias. In some sense, this is what\nthose responsible for the Literary Digest poll did. They incorrectly chose groups they believed would represent the\npopulation. If a person wants to do a survey on middle-class Americans, how would this person decide who to\ninclude? It would be left to this person\u2019s own judgment to create the criteria for those considered middle-class. This\nindividual\u2019s judgment might result in a different view of the middle class that might include wealthier individuals that\nothers would not consider part of the population. Similar to judgment sampling, in quota sampling , an individual or\norganization attempts to include the proper proportions of individuals of different subgroups in their sample. While\nit might sound like a good idea, it is subject to an individual\u2019s prejudice and is, therefore, prone to bias.\n224\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 11. Sampling Distributions and Estimation\nSize Bias\nIf one particular subgroup in a population is likely to be over-represented or under-represented due to its size, this is\nsometimes called size bias . If we chose a state at random from a map by closing our eyes and pointing to a particular\nplace, larger states would have a greater chance of being chosen than smaller ones. As another example, suppose\nthat we wanted to do a survey to \ufb01nd out the typical size of a student\u2019s math class at a school. The chances are\ngreater that we would choose someone from a larger class for our survey. To understand this, say that you went to\na very small school where there are only four math classes, with one class having 35 students, and the other three\nclasses having only 8 students. If you simply choose students at random, it is more likely you will select students for\nyour sample who will will say the typical size of a math class is 35, since there are more students in the larger class.\nResponse Bias\nThe term response bias refers to problems that result from the ways in which the survey or poll is actually presented\nto the individuals in the sample.\nVoluntary Response Bias\nTelevision and radio stations often ask viewers/listeners to call in with opinions about a particular issue they are\ncovering. The websites for these and other organizations also usually include some sort of online poll question of\nthe day. Reality television shows and fan balloting in professional sports to choose all-star players make use of these\ntypes of polls as well. All of these polls usually come with a disclaimer stating that, \u201cThis is not a scienti\ufb01c poll.\u201d\nWhile perhaps entertaining, these types of polls are very susceptible to voluntary response , orself-selection, bias .\nThe people who respond to these types of surveys tend to feel very strongly one way or another about the issue in\nquestion, and the results might not re\ufb02ect the overall population. Those who still have an opinion, but may not feel\nquite so passionately about the issue, may not be motivated to respond to the poll.\nNon-Response Bias\nOne of the biggest problems in polling is that most people just don\u2019t want to be bothered taking the time to respond\nto a poll of any kind. They hang up on a telephone survey, put a mail-in survey in the recycling bin, or walk quickly\npast an interviewer on the street. We just don\u2019t know how much these individuals\u2019 beliefs and opinions re\ufb02ect those\nof the general population, and, therefore, almost all surveys could be prone to non-response bias .\nQuestionnaire Bias\nQuestionnaire bias occurs when the way in which the question is asked in\ufb02uences the response given by the\nindividual. It is possible to ask the same question in two different ways that would lead individuals with the same\nbasic opinions to respond differently. Consider the following two questions about gun control.\n\"Do you believe that it is reasonable for the government to impose some limits on purchases of certain types\nof weapons in an effort to reduce gun violence in urban areas?\"\n\"Do you believe that it is reasonable for the government to infringe on an individual\u2019s constitutional right to\nbear arms?\"\nA gun rights activist might feel very strongly that the government should never be in the position of limiting guns in\nany way and would answer no to both questions. Someone who is very strongly against gun ownership, on the other\nhand, would probably answer yes to both questions. However, individuals with a more tempered, middle position on\nthe issue might believe in an individual\u2019s right to own a gun under some circumstances, while still feeling that there\nis a need for regulation. These individuals would most likely answer these two questions differently.\n225\n11.1. Surveys and Sampling www.ck12.org\nYou can see how easy it would be to manipulate the wording of a question to obtain a certain response to a poll\nquestion. Questionnaire bias is not necessarily always a deliberate action. If a question is poorly worded, confusing,\nor just plain hard to understand, it could lead to non-representative results. When you ask people to choose between\ntwo options, it is even possible that the order in which you list the choices may in\ufb02uence their response!\nIncorrect Response Bias\nA major problem with surveys is that you can never be sure that the person is actually responding truthfully. When an\nindividual intentionally responds to a survey with an untruthful answer, this is called incorrect response bias. This\ncan occur when asking questions about extremely sensitive or personal issues. For example, a survey conducted\nabout illegal drinking among teens might be prone to this type of bias. Even if guaranteed their responses are\ncon\ufb01dential, some teenagers may not want to admit to engaging in such behavior at all. Others may want to appear\nmore rebellious than they really are, but in either case, we cannot be sure of the truthfulness of the responses.\nIdentifying Sources of Bias\nExample A\nYou are assisting with a study attempting to determine the satisfaction of school communication with students who\nspeak a second language at home. The plan is to send home a questionnaire to the parents of the students, asking\nthem about their opinion.\nWhat kind(s) of bias is this survey method particularly prone to? How might they be addressed?\nSolution\nThis method of sampling is liable to result in both non-response and undercoverage bias. Non-response bias is an\nissue any time a sample population is expected to submit a questionnaire, as your results are going to include more\ninput from the type of person who is willing and able to complete and submit your survey. In this case, undercoverage\nis a particular problem, since the population most affected by the study is also unusually liable to misinterpret the\nquestions or the reason for them due to the language barrier.\nOne possible solution might be to conduct a phone survey conducted by a native speaker in the target language(s).\nExample B\nWhat type(s) of bias do the experiments below suggest?\na. An experiment to determine the danger of mixing household chemicals is conducted by collecting samples of\nchemicals found under the experimenter\u2019s sink.\nb. Mall shoppers are asked to \ufb01ll out and return a form rating their shopping experiences at each of the 26 stores\nto identify the most popular stores in each of 4 categories.\nc. A study of the average grades of mathematics students polls 16 Algebra I students, 14 Geometry students, 7\nCalculus students, and 19 Statistics students.\nSolution\na. Undercoverage bias \u2013This experiment is a prime example of the problems associated with convenience\nsampling , since the only chemicals used were the ones conveniently found in one location, the results could\nnot be assumed to be the same as with chemicals found under other sinks.\n226\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 11. Sampling Distributions and Estimation\nb. Non-response bias \u2013Since the results are dependent on the shoppers turning in a response form on their own,\nthe results will be biased toward a speci\ufb01c type of personality, and will not re\ufb02ect a true cross-section of\nshoppers\u2019 experiences.\nc. Undercoverage \u2013The study only includes approximately1\n2as many Calculus students as the other subjects.\nReducing Bias\nRandomization\nThe best technique for reducing bias in sampling is randomization . When a simple random sample of size n\n(commonly referred to as an SRS) is taken from a population, all possible samples of size nin the population have\nan equal probability of being selected for the sample. For example, if your statistics teacher wants to choose a student\nat random for a special prize, he or she could simply place the names of all the students in the class in a hat, mix\nthem up, and choose one. More scienti\ufb01cally, your teacher could assign each student in the class a number from 1 to\n25 (assuming there are 25 students in the class) and then use a computer or calculator to generate a random number\nto choose one student. This would be a simple random sample of size 1.\nA Note about Randomness\nTechnology Note: Generating Random Numbers\nIt is important that you understand that there is no such thing as true randomness, especially on a calculator or\ncomputer. When you choose the \u2019rand\u2019 function, the calculator has been programmed to return a ten digit decimal\nthat, using a very complicated mathematical formula, simulates randomness. Each digit, in theory, is equally likely\nto occur in any of the individual decimal places. What this means in practice is that if you had the patience (and\nthe time!) to generate a million of these on your calculator and keep track of the frequencies in a table, you would\n\ufb01nd there would be an approximately equal number of each digit. However, two brand-new calculators will give\nthe exact same sequences of random numbers! This is because the function that simulates randomness has to start\nat some number, called a seed value . All the calculators are programmed from the factory (or when the memory\nis reset) to use a seed value of zero. If you want to be sure that your sequence of random digits is different from\neveryone else\u2019s, you need to seed your random number function using a number different from theirs.\nSystematic Sampling\nThere are other types of samples that are not simple random samples, and one of these is a systematic sample. In\nsystematic sampling , after choosing a starting point at random, subjects are selected using a jump number. If you\nhave ever chosen teams or groups in gym class by counting off by threes or fours, you were engaged in systematic\nsampling. The jump number is determined by dividing the population size by the desired sample size to insure\nthat the sample combs through the entire population. If we had a list of everyone in your class of 25 students in\nalphabetical order, and we wanted to choose 5 of them, we would choose every 5thstudent. Let\u2019s try choosing a\nstarting point at random by generating a random number from 1 to 25. Assume we get the number 14 as our seed\nvalue.\nIn this case, we would start with student number 14 and then select every 5thstudent until we had 5 in all. When\nwe came to the end of the list, we would continue the count at number 1. Thus, our chosen students would be: 14,\n19, 24, 4, and 9. It is important to note that this is not a simple random sample, as not every possible sample of 5\nstudents has an equal chance of being chosen. For example, it is impossible to have a sample consisting of students\n5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n227\n11.1. Surveys and Sampling www.ck12.org\nCluster Sampling\nCluster sampling is when a naturally occurring group is selected at random, and then either all of that group, or\nrandomly selected individuals from that group, are used for the sample. If we select at random from out of that\ngroup, or cluster into smaller subgroups, this is referred to as multi-stage sampling . For example, to survey student\nopinions or study their performance, we could choose 5 schools at random from your state and then use an SRS\n(simple random sample) from each school. If we wanted a national survey of urban schools, we might \ufb01rst choose 5\nmajor urban areas from around the country at random, and then select 5 schools at random from each of these cities.\nThis would be both cluster and multi-stage sampling. Cluster sampling is often done by selecting a particular block\nor street at random from within a town or city. It is also used at large public gatherings or rallies. If of\ufb01cials take a\npicture of a small, representative area of the crowd and count the individuals in just that area, they can use that count\nto estimate the total crowd in attendance.\nStrati\ufb01ed Sampling\nInstrati\ufb01ed sampling , the population is divided into groups, called strata (the singular term is \u2019stratum\u2019), that have\nsome meaningful relationship. Very often, groups in a population that are similar may respond differently to a\nsurvey. In order to help re\ufb02ect the population, we stratify to insure that each opinion is represented in the sample.\nFor example, we often stratify by gender or race in order to make sure that the often divergent views of these different\ngroups are represented. In a survey of high school students, we might choose to stratify by school to be sure that the\nopinions of different communities are included. If each school has an approximately equal number of students, then\nwe could simply choose to take an SRS of size 25 from each school. If the numbers in each stratum are different,\nthen it would be more appropriate to choose a \ufb01xed sample (100 students, for example) from each school and take a\nnumber from each school proportionate to the total school size.\nLesson Summary\nIf you collect information from every unit in a population, it is called a census. Because a census is so dif\ufb01cult to\ndo, we instead take a representative subset of the population, called a sample, to try and make conclusions about\nthe entire population. The downside to sampling is that we can never be completely sure that we have captured\nthe truth about the entire population, due to random variation in our sample that is called sampling error. The list\nof the population from which the sample is chosen is called the sampling frame. Poor technique in surveying or\nchoosing a sample can also lead to incorrect conclusions about the population that are generally referred to as bias.\nSelection bias refers to choosing a sample that results in a subgroup that is not representative of the population.\nIncorrect sampling frame occurs when the group from which you choose your sample does not include everyone in\nthe population, or at least units that re\ufb02ect the full diversity of the population. Incorrect sampling frame errors result\nin undercoverage. This is where a segment of the population containing an important characteristic did not have an\nopportunity to be chosen for the sample and will be marginalized, or even left out altogether.\nPoints to Consider\n\u2022 How is the margin of error for a survey calculated?\n\u2022 What are the effects of sample size on sampling error?\nReview Questions\n1.

Sampling Distribution www.ck12.org\n11.2 Sampling Distribution\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Understand the inferential relationship between a sampling distribution and a population parameter.\n\u2022 Graph a frequency distribution of sample means using a data set.\n\u2022 Understand the relationship between sample size and the distribution of sample means.\n\u2022 Understand sampling error.\nIntroduction\nHave you ever wondered how we can learn what is true in a population when it would be impossible to contact\neveryone? Statistics allows us to make use of the tool of probability to estimate what is true from just a sample of\nthe subjects we are interested in.\nSuppose, for example, that we want to know how much cash people carry around in their pockets, on average. To\nmake this simple, we are going to work with a very small population of people: ten people on a busy street corner.\nThe diagram below reveals the amount of money that each person in the group of ten has in his/her pocket.\nOur Scenario\nIn this scenario, we have a population of size ten. One person has no money, another has $1.00, another has $2.00,\nand so on, until we reach the person who has $9.00. Our goal is to determine the average amount of money per\nperson in this population. What is that true mean? If you total the money of the ten people, you will \ufb01nd that the\nsum is $45.00, thus yielding a mean of $4.50. Of course, for the purpose of this exercise, we don\u2019t know this!\nSuppose you couldn\u2019t count the money of all ten people at once. Let\u2019s say instead you had 10 different individuals\nall taking samples of the population. To start, suppose each of the ten researchers were to randomly select a sample\nof only oneperson from the ten. That makes 10 samples of 1 person each. In this example, we would say that n = 1\n230\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 11. Sampling Distributions and Estimation\n(or sample size is one). The graph below shows the mean of each possible sample of n=1. (Since there is only one\nperson in each sample, the mean is the number of dollars in their pocket). Each of the 10 individuals was selected\nand constitutes their own sample of size n=1.\nThe distribution of the dots on the graph is an example of a sampling distribution . As can be seen, selecting a\nsample of one is not very good, since the range of sample means is anywhere from $0.00 to $9.00. The true mean of\n$4.50 could be missed by quite a bit with any one given sample.\nSample Size of n=2\nWhat happens if we take samples of two people at a time? From a population of 10, in how many ways can two\nbe selected if the order of the two does not matter? The answer, which is 45, can be found by using a graphing\ncalculator as shown in the \ufb01gure below. We select all possible samples of size two from the population and graph\nthe means of those samples. The sampling distribution of the sample means is as follows:\nIncreasing the sample size has improved your estimates. There are now 45 possible samples, such as ($0, $1), ($0,\n$2), ($7, $8), ($8, $9), and so on, and some of these samples produce the same means. For example, ($0, $6), ($1,\n231\n11.2. Sampling Distribution www.ck12.org\n$5), and ($2, $4) all produce means of $3. The three dots above the mean of 3 represent these three samples. In\naddition, the 45 means are not evenly distributed, as they were when the sample size was one. Instead, they are more\nclustered around the true mean of $4.50. ($0, $1) and ($8, $9) are the only two samples whose means deviate by as\nmuch as $4.00. Also, \ufb01ve of the samples yield the true estimate of $4.50, and another eight deviate by only plus or\nminus 50 cents.\nSample Size of n=3\nIf three people are randomly selected for each sample, there are 120 possible samples, which can be calculated with\na graphing calculator as shown below. The sampling distribution in this case is as follows:\nNext, the sampling distributions for sample sizes of 4, 5, and 6 are shown:\n232\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 11. Sampling Distributions and Estimation\nImpact of Sample Size\nFrom the graphs above, it is obvious that increasing the sample size resulted in a sampling distribution of means\nthat were more closely clustered around the true mean. Also, the sampling distribution of the sample means is\napproximately normal, as can be seen by the bell shape in each of the graphs. In case you are wondering, if a sample\nof size n=10 were selected, there would be only one possible sample, and it would yield the true mean of $4.50.\nImportant Lessons\nThere are two important pieces to take away from this lesson. First, notice that the sample means become more and\nmore normally distributed around the true mean (the population parameter) as we increase our sample size. Second,\nnotice that the variablity of the sample means decreases as sample size increases. The sample means are more tightly\n233\n11.2. Sampling Distribution www.ck12.org\nclustered around the true mean. This variablity of sample means is called the standard error ,s. You can think of\nit as the standard deviation of a sampling distribution.\nAnd here is one last piece of information to take away. The sampling distribution, as it becomes more normal\nin shape, also adheres to the Empirical Rule. This means that certain proportions of the sample means will fall\nwithin de\ufb01ned increments. In this case, each increment would be one standard error from the population parameter.\nAccording to this rule, 34% of the sample means will fall within one standard error above the population parameter,\nand another 34% will fall within one standard error below the population parameter. In addition, probability theory\nsays that 95% of the samples will fall within two standard errors of the true value, and 99.7% will fall within three\nstandard errors.\nLesson Summary\nIn this lesson, we have learned about probability sampling, which is the key sampling method used in survey\nresearch. In the example presented above, the elements were chosen for study from a population by random\nsampling. The sample size had a direct effect on the distribution of estimates of the population parameter. The\nlarger the sample size, the closer the sampling distribution was to a normal distribution.\nPoints to Consider\n\u2022 Does the mean of the sampling distribution equal the mean of the population?\n\u2022 If the sampling distribution is normally distributed, is the population normally distributed?\n\u2022 Are there any restrictions on the size of the sample that is used to estimate the parameters of a population?\n\u2022 Are there any other components of sampling error estimates?\nReview Questions\nThe following activity could be done in the classroom, with the students working in pairs or small groups. Before\ndoing the activity, students could put their pennies into a jar and save them as a class, with the teacher also\ncontributing. In a class of 30 students, groups of 5 students could work together, and the various tasks could be\ndivided among those in each group.\n1. If you had 100 pennies and were asked to record the age of each penny, predict the shape of the distribution.\n(The age of a penny is the current year minus the date on the coin.)\n2. Construct a histogram of the ages of the pennies.\n3. Calculate the mean of the ages of the pennies.\nHave each student in each group randomly select a sample of 5 pennies from the 100 coins and calculate the mean\nof the \ufb01ve ages of the coins chosen. Have the students then record their means on a number line. Have the students\nrepeat this process until all of the coins have been chosen.\n4. How does the mean of the samples compare to the mean of the population (100 ages)? Repeat step 4 using a\nsample size of 10 pennies. (As before, allow the students to work in groups.)\n5. What is happening to the shape of the sampling distribution of the sample means as the sample size increases?\n234\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 11. Sampling Distributions and Estimation\n11.3 Central Limit Theorem\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Understand one of the more remarkable theorems in all of mathematics, the Central Limit Theorem.\n\u2022 Recognize the relationship between the Normal distribution and the Central Limit Theorem.\nIntroduction\nIn the previous lesson, you learned that sampling is an important tool for determining the characteristic of a\npopulation. When we constructed a distribution of sample means, we saw that the sample means clustered around\nthe true mean. As the sample size increased, the shape of that distribution became more and more Normal. Although\nthe true mean of the population was unknown, random sampling yielded a reliable estimate. It is now time to learn\nhow one of the most remarkable theorems in statistics will allow us to estimate what is true in a population without\nhaving to repeatedly sample!\nCentral Limit Theorem\nTheCentral Limit Theorem is perhaps the most important theorem in statistics. It basically con\ufb01rms what might\nbe an intuitive truth to you by now: that as you increase the sample size for a random variable, the distribution of\nthe sample means better approximates a normal distribution.\nWhy is that idea so important? The reason is simple. Here is what this theorem allows us to do: If we can select a\nsingle sample of a known size from our population and calculate its mean, we can use the Central Limit Theorem to\npredict what that true population mean must be within a de\ufb01ned degree of con\ufb01dence. And, more importantly, this\nholds true no matter what the shape of the original distribution. That\u2019s pretty amazing.\nBefore going any further, you should become familiar with (or reacquaint yourself with) the symbols that are\ncommonly used when dealing with population values, sample statistics, and statistics of a sampling distribution\nof means. These symbols are shown in the table below. Note that the notation x(x-bar) is used to represent each\nvalue in a sampling distribution (rather than the random variable x) to indicate that each value is a sample mean.\nTABLE 11.1:\nPopulation Parameter Sample Statistic Sampling Distribution\nMean \u00b5 \u00afx \u00b5\u00afx\nStandard Deviation s s S\u00afxors\u00afx\nSize N n\nFormally, the CLT says:\nIf samples of size nare drawn at random from any population with a \ufb01nite mean and standard deviation, then\nthe sampling distribution of the sample means, x, approximates a normal distribution as nincreases.\nIn \u201cnormal English\u201d:\nIf you collect many samples from an ordinary random variable, and calculate the mean of each sample, then the\nmeans will be distributed in an approximate bell-curve, and the \u201cmean of means\u201d will be the same as the mean of\nthe population. The larger the size of the samples you collect, the more closely the distribution of their means will\n235\n11.3. Central Limit Theorem www.ck12.org\napproximate a normal distribution.\nUsing the Central Limit Theorem to Construct the Sampling Distribution\nSo how can we use the Central Limit Theorem to help us construct a sampling distribution without repeatedly\nsampling? We use what we know about the population and our proposed sample size to sketch the theoretical\nsampling distribution. Remember, to sketch a distribution we need to know its shape, center and spread.\nNotes to remember:\n\u2022 Shape of the sampling distribution: As long as your sample size is 30 or greater , you may assume the\ndistribution of the sample means to be approximately normal. This is true regardless of the original distribution\nof the random variable.\n\u2022 The mean of the distribution: The mean of a sampling distribution, as you saw in the last lesson, is the mean\nof the population. Formally: \u00b5x=\u00b5\n\u2022 The standard error of the distribution: The standard deviation of the sample means can be estimated by dividing\nthe standard deviation of the population by the square root of the sample size. Formally: sx=spn\nSo there you have it. You can use the three bullets points above to construct the sampling distribution. And then,\nsince the distribution will be normal with a sample size of 30 or more, you can use what we\u2019ve learned about the\narea under a Normal curve to calculate the probability of observing a particular sample mean!\nExample A\nThe time it takes a student to complete the mid-term for Algebra II is a bi-modal distribution with \u00b5=1hrand\ns=1hr. During the month of June, Professor Spence administers the test 64 times. What is the probability that the\naverage mid-term completion time for students during the month of June exceeds 48 minutes?\nSolution\nImportant facts:\n\u2022 There are more than 30 samples, so the Central Limit Theorem applies.\n\u2022 The mean of the sample should approximate the mean of the population, in other words \u00b5x=\u00b5\n\u2022 The standard deviation of Professor Spence\u2019s sample, sx, can be calculated as sx=spn, where n=64 (the\nnumber of tests/samples)\n\u2022 48 minutes is the same as48\n60=0:8hrs, so the range we are interested in is x>0:8hrs\nFirst calculate the standard deviation of the sample, using sx=spn:\nsx=1p\n64\nsx=0:125\nSince the sample is normally distributed, according to the CLT, we can use the standard deviation of the sample to\ncalculate the z-score of the minimum value in the relevant range, 0.80 hrs:\nZ=0:80\u00001\n0:125=\u00001:60\n236\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 11. Sampling Distributions and Estimation\nFinally, we use the z-score probability reference above to correlate the z-score of -1.60 to the probability of a value\ngreater than that\nP(Z\u0015\u00001:6) =:9452 or94:52%\nExample B\nEvan price-checked 123 online auction sellers to record their average asking price for his favorite game. According\nto a major nation price-checking site, the national average online auction cost for the game is $35.00 with a standard\ndeviation of $3.00. Evan found the prices less than $34.86 on average. How likely is this result?\nSolution\nSince there are more than 30 samples (123>30), we can apply the CLT theorem and treat the sample as a normal\ndistribution.\nThe standard deviation of the sample is: sx=3p\n123=3\n11:09=:27\nThez-score for Evan\u2019s price point of $34.86 is:\nZ=34:86\u000035\n:27=\u0000:14\n:27=\u00000:518\nConsulting the z-score probability table, we learn that the area under the normal curve less than 0.52 is .3015 or\n30.15%\nThe likelihood of 123 samples having a mean of $34.86 is approximately 30.15%\nExample C\nMack asked 42 fellow high-school students how much they spent for lunch, on average. According to his research\nonline, the amount spent for lunch by high school students nation wide has \u00b5=$15, with s=$9. We would assume\nthat Mark\u2019s random sample should fall within this sampling distribution. What is the probability that Mack\u2019s random\nsample will have a value that is within $0.01 of the national average?\nSolution\nThere are a few important facts to note here:\n\u2022 Mack\u2019s sample is 42 students, since 42 \u001530, he can safely assume that the sampling distribution of the sample\nmean will be approximately normal, according to the Central Limit Theorem.\n\u2022 The range we are considering is $14.99 to $15.01, since that represents $0.01 above and below the mean.\n\u2022 The mean of the sample should approximate the mean of the population, in other words \u00b5x=\u00b5\n\u2022 The standard deviation of Mack\u2019s sample, sx, can be calculated as sx=spn, where n=42\nLet\u2019s start by \ufb01nding the standard deviation of the sample, sx:\n237\n11.3. Central Limit Theorem www.ck12.org\nsx=9p\n42\n=9\n6:48\nsx=1:389\nSince Mack\u2019s sample of 42 samples can be assumed to be normally distributed, and since we now know the standard\ndeviation of the sample, 1.389, we can calculate the z-scores for the score at each end of the range using Z=x\u0000\u00b5x\nsx:\nZ1=15:01\u000015:00\n1:389= +0:01\nZ2=14:99\u000015:00\n1:389=\u00000:01\nFinally, we look up Z1andZ2on the Z-score probability table and we calculate the probability associated with the\nrange from z= -0.01 to z= 0.01. That value is 50.4% - 49.6% = 0.80%\nThe probability that Mack\u2019s sample will have a mean within $0.01 of the population mean of $15.00 is a little less\nthan 1%.\nLesson Summary\nThe Central Limit Theorem con\ufb01rms the intuitive notion that as the sample size increases for a random variable, the\ndistribution of the sample means will begin to approximate a normal distribution, with the mean equal to the mean\nof the underlying population and the standard deviation equal to the standard deviation of the population divided by\nthe square root of the sample size, n.\nVocabulary\nThe Central Limit Theorem states that if samples are drawn at random from any population with a \ufb01nite\nmean and standard deviation, then the sampling distribution of the sample means approximates a normal\ndistribution as the sample size increases beyond 30.\nThe sampling distribution of the sample means is a distribution of the means of multiple samples. It is\ncommonly assumed to be a normal distribution, though technically it is normal only if the sample size is\ngreater than 30.\nPoint to Consider\n\u2022 How does sample size affect the variation in sample results?\nGuided Practice\n1.

Earlier, we used descriptive statistics to\norganize and describe our data, or to explore relationships between quantitative and categorical variables. The goal\nof inferential statistics is to use sample data to increase our knowledge about the entire population . The remainder\nof this text deals with the different kinds of inferential statistical methods that you can use to test ideas about what\nis true in a population. In this section, we will focus on estimation. Estimation is the inferential technique used to\nestimate the true value of a population parameter, typically a mean, from a sample.\nCon\ufb01dence Intervals\nA sample mean can be referred to as a point estimate of a population mean. We call a sample mean a point estimate\nbecause this single number is used as a plausible value of the population mean. Keep in mind that some error is\nassociated with any estimate - the true population mean may be larger or smaller than the sample mean.\nBut not many of us would feel particularly con\ufb01dent in a point estimate. For example, let\u2019s say you wanted to\nknow what the average SAT was for students at a particular college. You asked a few students while visiting, and\nthe sample mean was 1280. Would you feel comfortable saying, \"The average SAT at this school is 1280.\" You\nprobably would realize that there is some sampling error involved. The true average SAT may be somewhat higher\nor somewhat less.\nAn alternative to reporting a point estimate is identifying a range of possible values the parameter might take. This\nrange of possible values is known as a con\ufb01dence interval . Associated with each con\ufb01dence interval is a con\ufb01dence\nlevel. This level indicates the level of assurance you have that the resulting con\ufb01dence interval encloses the unknown\npopulation mean.\nThe general concept of con\ufb01dence intervals is pretty intuitive: It is easier to predict that an unknown value will\nliesomewhere within a wide range than to predict it will occur within a narrow range (a single value!) .\nCalculating Con\ufb01dence Intervals\nAcon\ufb01dence interval is always centered around the mean of your sample. To construct the interval, you add\na margin of error. The margin of error is found by multiplying the standard error of the mean by the z-score of the\npercent con\ufb01dence level:\n241\n11.4. Con\ufb01dence Intervals www.ck12.org\ncon\ufb01dence interval =x\u0006margin of error\nmargin of error =Z\u0002spn\nThe end result looks something like this: we are 95% con\ufb01dent that the true average SAT for this college falls\nbetween 1210 and 1330. Sometimes, the con\ufb01dence interval is expressed like this: (1210, 1330).\nWhat do we mean by con\ufb01dence level ? Common choices for the con\ufb01dence level are 90%, 95%, and 99%. The\nselection of a con\ufb01dence level determines the probability that the con\ufb01dence interval produced will contain the true\nparameter value. So a con\ufb01dence level of 99% is higher than a con\ufb01dence level of 95%. The interval constructed\nwith 99% con\ufb01dence will have a higher chance of containing the true mean than an interval constructed with 95%\ncon\ufb01dence.\nFIGURE 11.1\nThe con\ufb01dence level derives from our understanding of the Central Limit Theorem. Think about the sampling\ndistribution for a population mean. If the sample size is at least thirty, the sampling distribution of the mean will be\nnearly normal. Therefore, any sample mean that we draw has a 95% chance of falling within \u00061.96 standard errors\nof the true population mean. (Remember your z scores).\nSo, if we want to construct an interval estimate for our population mean with 95% con\ufb01dence, we want to add a\nmargin of error that corresponds to \u00061.96 standard errors.\nSo wouldn\u2019t we always want to construct an interval with the highest con\ufb01dence level possible? Maybe not \u2013 and\nhere is why. The more con\ufb01dence in the interval, the wider it becomes. This means that you\u2019ve lost precision and\nthis could be a problem. Let\u2019s read on to see why that is.\nExample A\nSuppose the average height of a sample of 100 women is 50500, in other words, X=50500. Within what range of heights\ncan we expect the population mean to be, with 95% con\ufb01dence? Assume a standard deviation for the population of\n1.500.\nSolution\nHere is what we know:\n242\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 11. Sampling Distributions and Estimation\n\u2022 Our sample mean is 5\u20195\"\n\u2022 The standard deviation of the population is 1\u20195\"\n\u2022 Our sample size is 100.\nWe are asked for 95% con\ufb01dence, so we want to use z = \u00061.96.\n5:5\u00061:96\u00031:5=p\n100=5:5\u0006:294= (5:21;5:79)\nWe can conclude, with 95% con\ufb01dence, that the true average height for women is between 5\u20192\" and 5\u20198\".\nIf we instead wanted a 99% con\ufb01dence interval, what would that look like? Now we need z = \u00062.58.\nWe would conclude, with 99% con\ufb01dence, that the true average height for women is most likely between 5\u20191\"\nand 5\u20199\". Notice that we have greater con\ufb01dence, but we also have a less precise interval. Selecting the level of\ncon\ufb01dence is a tradeoff between how certain you want to be and how precise an interval you want.\nExample B\nSuppose you had 40 samples of bags of candy, each of which contains some number of pieces. The number of\npieces in each bag is said to be normally distributed. The mean number of candies in your sample is 38 pieces. The\nstandard deviation for bags in the population is 2 pieces. What is the average number of candies in each bag in the\npopulation? To answer this question, you need to create a con\ufb01dence interval. Let\u2019s assume that you have been\nasked to report a con\ufb01dence interval with 99% certainty.\nSolution\nSince the population is normally distributed, we can state that the mean of the sample follows the Empirical Rule.\nThe standard error of the mean is calculated asspn, soSEM =2p\n40=2\n6:32=:316\nSaying that you \u201cexpect 99 out of each 100 samples contain the population mean\u201d, is the same as saying that the\ninterval has a 99% con\ufb01dence level.\nThe interval is called the con\ufb01dence interval , and it is calculated as:\n38\u0006z0:005\u0002:316\n38\u00062:58\u0002:316\n38\u00060:81528\nTherefore, the con\ufb01dence interval is approximately 37.18 to 38.82. We are 99% con\ufb01dent that the average\nnumber of pieces in each bag of this candy in the population falls between 37 and 39 pieces (with rounding).\nWell, not exactly\nYou might have noticed in all the examples of con\ufb01dence intervals above that we used the population standard\ndeviation ( s) to calculate the standard error. In reality, this would never happen. In real life, you would only\nknow the sample standard deviation ( s). And what\u2019s the difference, you might ask?. It\u2019s very simple: if you only\nknow sample statistics, you can\u2019t use zin the con\ufb01dence interval formula. You have to use a different statistic\ncalled t. You haven\u2019t been introduced to tyet, so we stuck with z. That meant we had to make the crazy assumption\nthat you actually knew the standard deviation of the population! Think about how odd that would be \u2014 you are\ntrying to estimate the unknown mean of a population, but somehow you know the standard deviation.\n243\n11.4. Con\ufb01dence Intervals www.ck12.org\nYou will be introduced to the tstatistic in the next chapter. The logic of the con\ufb01dence interval will be the same but\nthe formula will change slightly:\ncon\ufb01dence interval =x\u0006margin of error\nmargin of error =t\u0002spn\nWe wanted you to see this formula now, as it is the \"real\" formula for con\ufb01dence intervals.\nInterpretation of a Con\ufb01dence Interval\nThe most common mistake made by persons interpreting a con\ufb01dence interval is claiming that a con\ufb01dence level\nindicates the probability that the mean of the population will occur within your interval! This is not true. Your\ninterval either does - or does not - contain the true population mean.\nWhat a 95% con\ufb01dence interval means is that if you took 100 samples, all of the same size, and formed 100\ncon\ufb01dence intervals, 95 of these intervals would capture the population mean. The probability is attributed to the\nmethod, not to any particular con\ufb01dence interval. This means if you repeated this sampling procedure 100 times, 95\nof the intervals produced would contain the population mean. The con\ufb01dence level indicates the number of times\nout of 100 that the mean of the population will be within the given interval of the sample mean.\nSuppose you plot the mean of each of 50 height samples on a graph, and drawing a line each way of the mean of\neach sample to represent 2 standard deviations. If you were to do this for all 50 of the samples, you might end up\nwith an image like the one below.\nAt the top of the image is a normal curve. Each of the lines below the curve has a length that represents a 95%\ncon\ufb01dence interval, centered on the mean (in red) of the sample.\na. What is indicated by the lines that are all red in color?\nb. What value is indicated by the vertical red center line on each interval?\nc. What does the \u201cpercent hit\u201d number mean? How would it change if you were to continue taking more and\nmore samples of 60 each?\n244\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 11. Sampling Distributions and Estimation\nSolutions\na. The lines that are colored entirely red have a mean that is greater than 2 standard deviations away from\nthe population mean. In other words, the mean of those two samples was not within the stated con\ufb01dence\ninterval (95%).\nb. The vertical red center line represents the mean of each sample.\nc. The \u201cpercent hit\u201d number indicates the percentage of times that the population mean was included in the\ncon\ufb01dence interval of sample means. If you were to continue plotting sample means and con\ufb01dence intervals,\nthe percent hit would approach 95%. In fact, here is the same graph after 1000 sample runs:\nLesson Summary\nIn this lesson, you learned that a sample mean is known as a point estimate, because this single number is used as a\nplausible value of the population mean. In addition to reporting a point estimate, you discovered how to calculate an\ninterval of reasonable values based on the sample data. This interval estimator of the population mean is called the\ncon\ufb01dence interval. You can calculate this interval for the population mean by using the formula \u00af x\u0006za\n2\u0012\nspn\u0013\n. The\nvalue of za\n2is different for each con\ufb01dence interval of 90%, 95%, and 99%. You also learned that the probability is\nattributed to the method used to calculate the con\ufb01dence interval.\nPoints to Consider\n\u2022 Does replacing swith schange your chance of capturing the unknown population mean?\n\u2022 Is there a way to increase the chance of capturing the unknown population mean?\nVocabulary\nAcon\ufb01dence interval is the interval within which you expect to capture a speci\ufb01c value.

How might you\norganize data on male and female watchers, and action, romance, comedy, and horror movie types, so it would be\neasy to compare the different combinations?\nContingency tables are used to evaluate the interaction of two different categorical variables. Contingency tables\nare sometimes called two-way tables because they are organized with the outputs of one variable across the top, and\nanother down the side. Consider the table below:\nTABLE 6.1:\nMale Female\nChocolate Candy 42 77\nFruit Candy 58 23\nThis is a contingency table comparing the variable \u2019Gender\u2019 with the variable \u2019Candy Preference\u2019. You can see that,\nacross the top of the table are the two gender options for this particular study: \u2019male students\u2019 and \u2019female students\u2019.\nDown the left side are the two candy preference options: \u2019chocolate\u2019 and \u2019fruit\u2019. The data in the center of the table\nindicates the reported candy preferences of the 200 students polled during the study.\nCommonly, there will be one additional row and column for totals, like this:\nTABLE 6.2:\nMale Female TOTAL\nChocolate Candy 42 77 119\nFruit Candy 58 23 81\nTOTAL 100 100 200\nNotice that you can run a quick check on the calculation of totals, since the \u201ctotal of totals\u201d should be the same from\neither direction: 119 +81=200=100+100.\nAmarginal distribution is how many overall responses there were for each category of the variable. The marginal\ndistribution of a variable can be determined by looking at the \"Total\" column (for type of candy) or the \"Total\" row\n(for gender). For example, we can see that the marginal totals for type of candy are 119 chocolate and 81 fruit.\nSimilarly, the marginal total for gender tells us there were an equal number of males and females in the study.\nExample A\nConstruct a contingency table to display the following data:\n116\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 6.

Assume you have an opportunity to invest some\nmoney in a software company. Suppose you know that the company\u2019s records indicate that in the past \ufb01ve years, its\npro\ufb01ts have been consistently decreasing. Would you still invest your money in it? Do you think the chances are\ngood for the company in the future?\nHere is another illustration. Suppose that you are playing a game that involves tossing a single die. Assume that\nyou have already tossed it 10 times, and every time the outcome was the same, a 2. What is your prediction of the\neleventh toss? Would you be willing to bet $100 that you will not get a 2 on the next toss? Do you think the die is\nloaded?\nNotice that the decision concerning a successful investment in the software company and the decision of whether or\nnot to bet $100 on the next outcome of the die are both based on probabilities of certain sample results. Namely, the\nsoftware company\u2019s pro\ufb01ts have been declining for the past \ufb01ve years, and the outcome of rolling a 2 ten times in a\nrow seems strange. From these sample results, we might conclude that we are not going to invest our money in the\nsoftware company or bet on this die. In this lesson, you will learn mathematical ideas and tools that can help you\nunderstand such situations.\nEvents, Sample Spaces, and Probability\nAnevent is something that occurs, or happens. For example, \ufb02ipping a coin is an event, and so is walking in the\npark and passing by a bench. Anything that could possibly happen is an event.\nEvery event has one or more possible outcomes. While tossing a coin is an event, getting tails is the outcome of that\nevent. Likewise, while walking in the park is an event, \ufb01nding your friend sitting on the bench is an outcome of that\nevent.\nSuppose a coin is tossed once. There are two possible outcomes, either heads, H, or tails, T. Notice that if the\nexperiment is conducted only once, you will observe only one of the two possible outcomes. An experiment is the\nprocess of taking a measurement or making an observation. These individual outcomes for an experiment are each\ncalled simple events .\nExample A\nA die has six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. When we toss it once, only one of the six outcomes of this\nexperiment will occur. The one that does occur is called a simple event.\n121\n6.2. Basic Rules of Probability We Need to Know www.ck12.org\nExample B\nSuppose that two pennies are tossed simultaneously. We could have both pennies land heads up (which we write as\nHH), or the \ufb01rst penny could land heads up and the second one tails up (which we write as HT), etc. We will see\nthat there are four possible outcomes for each toss, which are HH;HT;T H, and T T.\nWhat we have accomplished so far is a listing of all the possible events of an experiment. This collection is called\nthesample space of the experiment. The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment, or the\ncollection of all the possible simple events of an experiment. We will denote a sample space by S.\nExample C\nWe want to determine the sample space of throwing a die and the sample space of tossing a coin.\nSolution\nAs we know, there are 6 possible outcomes for throwing a die. We may get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, so we write the sample\nspace as the set of all possible outcomes:\nS=f1;2;3;4;5;6g\nSimilarly, the sample space of tossing a coin is either heads, H, or tails, T, so we write S=fH;Tg.\nExample D\nSuppose a box contains three balls, one red, one blue, and one white. One ball is selected, its color is observed, and\nthen the ball is placed back in the box. The balls are scrambled, and again, a ball is selected and its color is observed.\nWhat is the sample space of the experiment?\nIt is probably best if we draw a tree diagram to illustrate all the possible selections.\nAs you can see from the tree diagram, it is possible that you will get the red ball, R, on the \ufb01rst drawing and then\nanother red one on the second, RR. You can also get a red one on the \ufb01rst and a blue on the second, and so on. From\nthe tree diagram above, we can see that the sample space is as follows:\n122\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 6. Relationships between Categorical Variables\nS=fRR;RB;RW;BR;BB;BW;WR;WB;WWg\nEach pair in the set above gives the \ufb01rst and second drawings, respectively. That is, RWis different from WR.\nExample E\nConsider the same experiment as in the last example. This time we will draw one ball and record its color, but we\nwill not place it back into the box. We will then select another ball from the box and record its color. What is the\nsample space in this case?\nSolution\nThe tree diagram below illustrates this case:\nYou can clearly see that when we draw, say, a red ball, the blue and white balls will remain. So on the second\nselection, we will either get a blue or a while ball. The sample space in this case is as shown:\nS=fRB;RW;BR;BW;WR;WBg\nNow let us return to the concept of probability and relate it to the concepts of sample space and simple events. If\nyou toss a fair coin, the chance of getting tails, T, is the same as the chance of getting heads, H. Thus, we say that\nthe probability of observing heads is 0.5, and the probability of observing tails is also 0.5. The probability, P, of an\noutcome, A, always falls somewhere between two extremes: 0, which means the outcome is an impossible event,\nand 1, which means the outcome is guaranteed to happen. Most outcomes have probabilities somewhere in-between.\nProperty 1: 0\u0014P(A)\u00141, for any event, A.\nThe probability of an event, A, ranges from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).\nIn addition, the probabilities of all possible simple outcomes of an event must add up to 1. This 1 represents certainty\nthat one of the outcomes must happen. For example, tossing a coin will produce either heads or tails. Each of these\ntwo outcomes has a probability of 0.5. This means that the total probability of the coin landing either heads or tails\nis 0:5+0:5=1:That is, we know that if we toss a coin, we are certain to get heads or tails.\n123\n6.2. Basic Rules of Probability We Need to Know www.ck12.org\nProperty 2: \u00e5P(A) =1 when summed over all possible simple outcomes.\nThe sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes must add up to 1.\nNotice that tossing a coin or throwing a die results in outcomes that are all equally probable. That is, each outcome\nhas the same probability as all the other outcomes in the same sample space. Getting heads or tails when tossing a\ncoin produces an equal probability for each outcome, 0.5. Throwing a die has 6 possible outcomes, each also having\nthe same probability,1\n6. We refer to this kind of probability as classical probability. Classical probability is de\ufb01ned\nto be the ratio of the number of cases favorable to an event to the number of all outcomes possible, where each of\nthe outcomes is equally likely.\nProbability is usually denoted by P, and the respective elements of the sample space (the outcomes) are denoted by\nA;B;C;etc. The mathematical notation that indicates the probability that an outcome, A, happens is P(A). We use\nthe following formula to calculate the probability of an outcome occurring:\nP(A) =The number of outcomes for Ato occur\nThe size of the sample space\nExample F\nWhen tossing two coins, what is the probability of getting a head on both coins, HH? Is the probability classical?\nSince there are 4 elements (outcomes) in the sample space set, fHH;HT;T H;T Tg, its size is 4. Furthermore, there\nis only 1 HHoutcome that can occur. Therefore, using the formula above, we can calculate the probability as shown:\nP(A) =The number of outcomes for HHto occur\nThe size of the sample space=1\n4=25%\nNotice that each of the 4 possible outcomes is equally likely. The probability of each is 0.25. Also notice that the\ntotal probability of all possible outcomes in the sample space is 1.\nExample G\nWhat is the probability of throwing a die and getting A=2;3;or 4?\nThere are 6 possible outcomes when you toss a die. Thus, the total number of outcomes in the sample space is 6.\nThe event we are interested in is getting a 2, 3, or 4, and there are three ways for this event to occur.\nP(A) =The number of outcomes for 2, 3, or 4 to occur\nThe size of the sample space=3\n6=1\n2=50%\nTherefore, there is a probability of 0.5 that we will get 2, 3, or 4.\nExample H\nConsider tossing two coins. Assume the coins are not balanced. The design of the coins is such that they produce\nthe probabilities shown in the table below:\n124\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 6.

Relationships between Categorical Variables\n6.3Conditional Probability\nLearning Objective\n\u2022 Calculate the conditional probability that event Aoccurs, given that event Bhas occurred.\n\u2022 Understand the difference between independent and dependent events.\nIntroduction\nIn this lesson, you will learn about the concept of conditional probability and be presented with some examples\nof how conditional probability is used in the real world. Once we understand the basics of conditional probability\nin this chapter, we can begin to think about how these concepts can be used to determine whether two categorical\nvariables are related or, in the language of probability, whether they are independent.\nNotation\nWe know that the probability of observing an even number on a throw of a die is 0.5. Let the event of observing an\neven number be event A. Now suppose that we throw the die, and we know that the result is a number that is 3 or\nless. Call this event B. Would the probability of observing an even number on that particular throw still be 0.5? The\nanswer is no, because with the introduction of event B, we have reduced our sample space from 6 simple events to 3\nsimple events. In other words, since we have a number that is 3 or less, we now know that we have a 1, 2 or 3. This\nbecomes, in effect, our sample space. Now the probability of observing a 2 is1\n3. With the introduction of a particular\ncondition (event B), we have changed the probability of a particular outcome. The Venn diagram below shows the\nreduced sample space for this experiment, given that event Bhas occurred:\nThe only even number in the sample space for Bis the number 2. We conclude that the probability that Aoccurs,\ngiven that Bhas occurred, is 1:3, or1\n3. We write this with the notation P(AjB), which reads \u201cthe probability of A,\ngiven B.\u201d So for the die toss experiment, we would write P(AjB) =1\n3.\nConditional Probability of Two Events\nIfAandBare two events, then the probability of event Aoccurring, given that event Bhas occurred, is called\nconditional probability . We write it with the notation P(AjB), which reads \u201cthe probability of A, given B.\u201d\n127\n6.3. Conditional Probability www.ck12.org\nTo calculate the conditional probability that event Aoccurs, given that event Bhas occurred, take the ratio of the\nprobability that both AandBoccur to the probability that Boccurs. That is:\nP(AjB) =P(A\\B)\nP(B)\nFor our example above, the die toss experiment, we proceed as is shown below:\nA: observe an even number\nB: observe a number less than or equal to 3\nTo \ufb01nd the conditional probability, we use the formula as follows:\nP(AjB) =P(A\\B)\nP(B)=P(2)\nP(1)+P(2)+P(3)=1\n6\n3\n6=1\n3\nExample\nA medical research center is conducting experiments to examine the relationship between cigarette smoking and\ncancer in a particular city in the USA. Let Arepresent an individual who smokes, and let Crepresent an individual\nwho develops cancer. This means that ACrepresents an individual who smokes and develops cancer, AC0represents\nan individual who smokes but does not develop cancer, and so on. We have four different possibilities, or simple\nevents, and they are shown in the table below, along with their associated probabilities.\nTABLE 6.12:\nSimple Events Probabilities\nAC 0.10\nAC00.30\nA0C 0.05\nA0C00.55\nThese simple events can be studied, along with their associated probabilities, to examine the relationship between\nsmoking and cancer.\nWe have:\nA: individual smokes\nC: individual develops cancer\n128\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 6. Relationships between Categorical Variables\nA0: individual does not smoke\nC0: individual does not develop cancer\nA very powerful way of examining the relationship between cigarette smoking and cancer is to compare the condi-\ntional probability that an individual gets cancer, given that he/she smokes, with the conditional probability that an\nindividual gets cancer, given that he/she does not smoke. In other words, we want to compare P(CjA)with P(CjA0).\nRecall that P(CjA) =P(C\\A)\nP(A).\nBefore we can use this relationship, we need to calculate the value of the denominator. P(A)is the probability of an\nindividual being a smoker in the city under consideration. To calculate it, remember that the probability of an event\nis the sum of the probabilities of all its simple events. A person can smoke and have cancer, or a person can smoke\nand not have cancer. That is:\nP(A) =P(AC)+P(AC0) =0:10+0:30=0:4\nThis tells us that according to this study, the probability of \ufb01nding a smoker selected at random from the sample\nspace (the city) is 40%. We can continue on with our calculations as follows:\nP(CjA) =P(A\\C)\nP(A)=P(AC)\nP(A)=0:10\n0:40=0:25=25%\nSimilarly, we can calculate the conditional probability of a nonsmoker developing cancer:\nP(CjA0) =P(A0\\C)\nP(A0)=P(A0C)\nP(A0)=0:05\n0:60=0:08=8%\nIn this calculation, P(A0) =P(A0C)+P(A0C0) =0:05+0:55=0:60.P(A0)can also be found by using the Comple-\nment Rule as shown: P(A0) =1\u0000P(A) =1\u00000:40=0:60.\nFrom these calculations, we can clearly see that a relationship exists between smoking and cancer. The probability\nthat a smoker develops cancer is 25%, and the probability that a nonsmoker develops cancer is only 8%. Keep in\nmind, though, that it would not be accurate to say that smoking causes cancer. However, our \ufb01ndings do suggest a\nstrong link between smoking and cancer.\nIndependence\nSuppose you are \ufb02ipping a coin and at the same time rolling a dice. Obviously, the probability of rolling a 3 has\nnothing to do with whether the coin lands heads or tails. Such events are known as independent .\nEvent B is said to be independent of event A if P(BlA) = P(B). Alternatively, P(AlB) = P(A)\nIf the above is not true, then the events are said to be dependent . There are other less obvious examples that we\nfrequently encounter. Suppose your math teacher was recently at an event featuring door prizes. The prizes varied\nin value from water bottles to a kayak. Suppose there are 200 names in the drawing. If you are like you math teacher\nand never win anything, would you prefer them to start the drawing with the kayak or the water bottles? How does\nthe probability of getting you name drawn change as they draw more names?\n129\n6.3.

Relationships between Categorical Variables\n6.4Examining Independence of Categorical\nVariables\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Apply what you have learned about conditional probabilities to determine if two categorical variables in\ufb02uence\neach other or not.\nBivariate Relationships for Categorical Data\nSuppose you conducted a survey where you asked each person two questions: \"Do you have Cable TV?\" and \"Did\nyou go on vacation in the past year?.\" You now have data on two categorical variables for each person. As we have\nseen, whenever you have two pieces of data from each person, you can organize the data into a two-way frequency\ntable, orcontingency table .\nHere is data collected from a group of individuals who answered those two questions in a contingency table:\nTABLE 6.13:\nTook a Vacation No Vacation Total\nHave Cable TV 97 38 135\nDon\u2019t Have Cable TV 14 17 31\nTotal 111 55 166\nThe numbers in the frequency table show the numbers of people that \ufb01t each pair of preferences. For example, 97\npeople have cable TV and took a vacation last year. 38 people have cable TV but did not take a vacation last year.\nThe totals of the rows and columns have been added to the frequency table for convenience. From the far right\ncolumn you can see that 135 people have cable TV and 31 people don\u2019t have cable TV for a total of 166 people\nsurveyed. From the bottom row you can see that 111 people took a vacation and 55 people did not take a vacation\nfor a total of 166 people surveyed.\nYou can use the two-way frequency table to calculate probabilities about the people surveyed. For example, you\ncould \ufb01nd:\na. The probability that a random person selected from this group took a vacation last year.\nb. The probability that a random person from this group who has cable TV took a vacation last year.\nc. Whether or not \u201cchoosing a person with cable TV\u201d and \u201cchoosing a person who took a vacation\u201d are indepen-\ndent events for this population of 166 people.\nExample A\nSuppose you choose a person at random from the group surveyed below. Let Abe the event that the person chosen\ntook a vacation last year. Find P(A).\nTABLE 6.14:\nTook a Vacation No Vacation Total\nHave Cable TV 97 38 135\n131\n6.4. Examining Independence of Categorical Variables www.ck12.org\nTABLE 6.14: (continued)\nDon\u2019t Have Cable TV 14 17 31\nTotal 111 55 166\nSolution\nThere were 166 people surveyed, so there are 166 outcomes in the sample space. 111 people took a vacation last\nyear.\nP(A) =111\n166\u00190:67or67%\nExample B\nSuppose you choose a person at random from the group surveyed below. Let Abe the event that the person chosen\ntook a vacation last year. Let Bbe the event that the person chosen has cable TV . Find P(AjB).\nTABLE 6.15:\nTook a Vacation No Vacation Total\nHave Cable TV 97 38 135\nDon\u2019t Have Cable TV 14 17 31\nTotal 111 55 166\nSolution\nYou are looking for the probability that the person took a vacation given that they have cable TV . Since you know\nthat the person has cable TV , the sample space has been restricted to the 135 people with cable TV . 97 of those\npeople took a vacation.\nP(AjB) =97\n135\u0019:72or72%\nSuppose you wanted to use the conditional probability formula for this calculation.\nP(AjB) =P(A\\B)\nP(B)=97\n166\n135\n166=97\n135\u00190:72or72%\nWith the conditional probability formula, each probability is calculated with the sample space of 166. The two\n166\u2019s cancel each other out, and the result is the same. Sometimes it makes sense to use the conditional probability\nformula, and sometimes it is easier to think logically about what is being asked.\nExample C\nSuppose you choose a person at random from the group surveyed below. Let Abe the event that the person chosen\ntook a vacation last year. Let Bbe the event that the person chosen has cable TV . Are events AandBindependent?\n132\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 6.

As we learned in the last chapter, two events\nare independent if the following statement is true:\nP(AjB) =P(A)\nFrom Example A, you know that P(A) =67%. From Example B, you know that P(AjB) =72% because these\nprobabilities are not equal, the two events are NOT independent (they are dependent). People with cable TV are\nmore likely to have taken a vacation as opposed to people without cable TV , so knowing that a person has cable TV\nincreases the probability that they took a vacation.\nVocabulary\nTheprobability of an event is the chance of the event occurring.\nTwo events are independent if one event occurring does not change the probability of the second event occur-\nring. P(A\\B) =P(A)P(B)if and only if AandBare independent events. Also, P(AjB) =P(A)andP(BjA) =\nP(B)if and only if AandBare independent events.\nTwo events are dependent if one event occurring causes the probability of the second event to go up or down.\nTheconditional probability of event Agiven event Bis the probability of event Aoccurring given event B\noccurred. The notation is P(AjB), which is read as \u201cthe probability of Agiven B\u201d.\nAtwo-way table, orcontingency table ,organizes data when two categories are associated with each per-\nson/object being classi\ufb01ed.\nGuided Practice\nA group of 110 students was surveyed about what grade they were in and whether they preferred dogs or cats. 20 9th\ngraders preferred dogs, 5 9th graders preferred cats, 16 10th graders preferred dogs, 4 10th graders preferred cats,\n22 11th graders preferred dogs, 6 11th graders preferred cats, 30 12th graders preferred dogs, and 7 12th graders\npreferred cats.\n1.

But what if we notice that two variables\nseem to be related? We may notice that the values of two variables, such as verbal SAT score and GPA, behave in\nthe same way and that students who have a high verbal SAT score also tend to have a high GPA (see table below).\nIn this case, we would want to study the nature of the connection between the two variables.\nTABLE 5.1: A Table of Verbal SAT Values and GPAs for Seven Students\nStudent SAT Score GPA\n1 595 3.4\n2 520 3.2\n3 715 3.9\n4 405 2.3\n5 680 3.9\n6 490 2.5\n7 565 3.5\nThese types of studies are quite common, and we can use the concept of correlation to describe the relationship\nbetween the two variables.\nBivariate Data, Correlation Between Values, and the Use of Scatterplots\nCorrelation measures the linear relationship between two quantitative variables. Correlation is possible when we\nhave bivariate data . In other words, when the subjects in our dataset have scores on two separate quantitative\nvariables, we have bivariate data. In our example above, we notice that there are two observations (verbal SAT score\nand GPA) for each subject (in this case, a student). Can you think of other scenarios when we would use bivariate\ndata?\nIf we carefully examine the data in the example above, we notice that those students with high SAT scores tend to\nhave high GPAs, and those with low SAT scores tend to have low GPAs. In this case, there is a tendency for students\nto score similarly on both variables, and the performance between variables appears to be related.\n103\n5.1. Scatterplots and Linear Correlation www.ck12.org\nCorrelation Patterns in Scatterplot Graphs\nScatterplots , like the one below, display bivariate data and provide a visual representation of the relationship\nbetween the two variables. In a scatterplot, each point represents a paired measurement of two variables for a\nspeci\ufb01c subject, and each subject is represented by one point on the scatterplot.\nDirection of Relationship\nExamining a scatterplot graph allows us to obtain some idea about the relationship between two variables. When the\npoints on a scatterplot graph produce a lower-left-to-upper-right pattern (see below), we say that there is a positive\ncorrelation between the two variables. This pattern means that when the score of one observation is high, we expect\nthe score of the other observation to be high as well, and vice versa.\nWhen the points on a scatterplot graph produce a upper-left-to-lower-right pattern (see below), we say that there is a\nnegative correlation between the two variables. This pattern means that when the score of one observation is high,\nwe expect the score of the other observation to be low, and vice versa.\nWhen all the points on a scatterplot lie on a straight line, you have what is called a perfect correlation between the\ntwo variables (see below).\n104\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 5. Relationships between Quantitative Variables\nA scatterplot in which the points do not have a linear trend (either positive or negative) is called a zero correlation\nor anear-zero correlation (see below).\nMagnitude of Relationship\nWhen examining scatterplots, we also want to look not only at the direction of the relationship (positive, negative,\nor zero), but also at the magnitude of the relationship. If we drew an imaginary oval around all of the points on\nthe scatterplot, we would be able to see the extent, or the magnitude, of the relationship. If the points are close to\none another and the width of the imaginary oval is small, this means that there is a strong correlation between the\nvariables (see below).\n105\n5.1. Scatterplots and Linear Correlation www.ck12.org\nHowever, if the points are far away from one another, and the imaginary oval is very wide, this means that there is a\nweak correlation between the variables (see below).\nCorrelation Coef\ufb01cient\nWhile examining scatterplots gives us some idea about the relationship between two variables, we use a statistic\ncalled the Pearson correlation coef\ufb01cient to give us a more precise measurement of the relationship between the\ntwo variables. We use rto denote the correlation coef\ufb01cient, and rhas the following properties:\n\u2022ris always a value between -1 and +1\n\u2022 The further an rvalue is from zero, the stronger the relationship between the two variables. The absolute value\nof the coef\ufb01cient indicates the magnitude, or strength, of the relationship.\n\u2022 The sign of rindicates the nature of the relationship: A positive rindicates a positive relationship, and a\nnegative rindicates a negative relationship.\nIf two variables have a perfect linear relationship (meaning they fall on a straight line), then ris equal to 1.0 or -1.0,\ndepending on the direction of the relationship. When there is no linear relationship between two variables, r=0. It is\nimportant to remember that a correlation coef\ufb01cient of 0 means that there is no linear relationship, but there may still\nbe a relationship between the two variables. For example, there could be a quadratic relationship between them.\nThe name of this statistics is the Pearson product-moment correlation coef\ufb01cient .It is symbolized by the letter r.\nGenerally speaking, you may think of the values of rin the following manner:\n106\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 5. Relationships between Quantitative Variables\n\u2022 Ifjrjis between 0.85 and 1, there is a strong correlation.\n\u2022 Ifjrjis between 0.5 and 0.85, there is a moderate correlation.\n\u2022 Ifjrjis between 0.1 and 0.5, there is a weak correlation.\n\u2022 Ifjrjis less than 0.1, there is no apparent correlation.\nCoef\ufb01cient of Determination\nAt the risk of overloading you with new terms, there is one more that is worth learning in this lesson, the coef\ufb01cient\nof determination . The coef\ufb01cient of determination is very simple to calculate if you know the correlation coef\ufb01cient,\nsince it is just r2. The coef\ufb01cient of determination can be interpreted as the percentage of variation of the yvariable\nthat can be attributed to the relationship. In other words, a value of r2=:63 can be interpreted as \u201c63% of the\nvariation in Y can be attributed to the variation in X.\"\nThus, the correlation coef\ufb01cient not only provides a measure of the relationship between the variables, but it also\ngives us an idea about how much of the total variance of one variable can be associated with the variance of the\nother. The higher the correlation we have between two variables, the larger the portion of the variance that can be\nexplained by the independent variable.\nExample A\nElaina is curious about the relationship between the weight of a dog and the amount of food it eats. Speci\ufb01cally, she\nwonders if heavier dogs eat more food, or if age and size factor in. She works at the Humane Society, and does some\nresearch. After some calculation, she determines that dog weight and food weight exhibit an r-value of 0.73. What\ncan Elaina say about the relationship, based on her research? What percentage of the increases in food intake can\nshe attribute to weight, according to her research?\n107\n5.1. Scatterplots and Linear Correlation www.ck12.org\nSolution\nThe calculated r-value of 0.73 tells us that Elaina\u2019s data demonstrates a moderate to strong correlation between the\nvariables.\nSince the coef\ufb01cient of determination tells us the percentage of changes in the output variable that can be attributed\nto the input variable, we need to calculate r2:\nr2= (0:73)2=:5329\nApproximately 53% of increases in food intake can be attributed to the linear relationship between food intake and\nthe weight of the dog. Since weight explains less than 100% of the difference in food intake, this suggests that other\nfactors, perhaps age and size, are also involved.\nExample B\nTuscany wonders if barrel racing times are related to the age of the horse. Speci\ufb01cally, she wonders if older horses\ntake longer to complete a barrel racing run. As a member of the Pony Club, she does some research, and determines\nthat horse age to barrel run time exhibits an r-value of 0.52.\nWhat can Tuscany say about horse age vs barrel race time, according to her research?\nSolution\nTuscany\u2019s research suggests that there is a moderate to weak correlation between horse age and barrel run time. In\nother words, the research suggests that (0:52)2=:27=27% of the differences between barrel run times could be\nattributable to the linear relationship between barrel run time and the age of the horse.\nHow to Calculate r\nTo understand how this coef\ufb01cient is calculated, let\u2019s suppose that there is a positive relationship between two\nvariables, XandY. If a subject has a score on Xthat is above the mean, we expect the subject to have a score on Y\nthat is also above the mean. Pearson developed his correlation coef\ufb01cient by computing the sum of cross products.\nHe multiplied the two scores, XandY, for each subject and then added these cross products across the individuals.\nNext, he divided this sum by the number of subjects minus one. This coef\ufb01cient is, therefore, the mean of the cross\nproducts of scores.\nPearson used standard scores ( z-scores, t-scores, etc.) when determining the coef\ufb01cient.\nTherefore, the formula for this coef\ufb01cient is as follows:\nrXY=\u00e5zXzY\nn\u00001\nIn other words, the coef\ufb01cient is expressed as the sum of the cross products of the standard z-scores divided by the\nnumber of degrees of freedom. For correlation, df = n-1, where nis the number of bivariate data points in your\nanalysis.\n108\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 5. Relationships between Quantitative Variables\nCalculating r from Descriptive Statistics\nIf you have the raw scores for your data, along with the mean and standard deviation of each variable, you can\nalso calculate rusing the following formula. This formula is less computationally intensive when you are trying to\ncalculate rby hand:\nrXY=SP\n(n\u00001)(sx)(sy)\nwhere SP stands for sum of products. To calculate SP, use the following formula:\nSP=\u00e5xy\u0000(\u00e5x)(\u00e5y)\nn\nCalculating r from Raw Scores Only\nAn equivalent formula that uses the raw scores only is called the raw score formula and is written as follows:\nrXY=n\u00e5xy\u0000\u00e5x\u00e5yrh\nn\u00e5x2\u0000(\u00e5x)2irh\nn\u00e5y2\u0000(\u00e5y)2i\nNote that nis used instead of n\u00001, because we are using actual data and not z-scores. Let\u2019s use our example from\nthe introduction to demonstrate how to calculate the correlation coef\ufb01cient using the raw score formula.\nExample C\nWhat is the Pearson product-moment correlation coef\ufb01cient for the two variables represented in the table below?\nTABLE 5.2: Table of Values for this Example\nStudent SAT Score GPA\n1 595 3.4\n2 520 3.2\n3 715 3.9\n4 405 2.3\n5 680 3.9\n6 490 2.5\n7 565 3.5\nIn order to calculate the correlation coef\ufb01cient, we need to calculate several pieces of information, including xy;x2,\nandy2.

For example, a third variable or a combination of other things may be causing the two correlated\nvariables to relate as they do. Therefore, it is important to remember that we are interpreting the variables and the\nvariance not as causal, but instead as relational.\nWhen examining correlation, there are four things that could affect our results: lack of linearity, outliers, homogene-\nity of the group, and sample size.\nAs mentioned, the correlation coef\ufb01cient is the measure of the linear relationship between two variables. However,\nwhile many pairs of variables have a linear relationship, some do not. For example, let\u2019s consider performance anxi-\nety. As a person\u2019s anxiety about performing increases, so does his or her performance up to a point. (We sometimes\n110\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 5. Relationships between Quantitative Variables\ncall this good stress.) However, at some point, the increase in anxiety may cause a person\u2019s performance to go\ndown. We call these non-linear relationships curvilinear relationships . We can identify curvilinear relationships\nby examining scatterplots (see below). One may ask why curvilinear relationships pose a problem when calculating\nthe correlation coef\ufb01cient. The answer is that if we use the traditional formula to calculate these relationships,\nit will not be an accurate index, and we will be underestimating the relationship between the variables. If we\ngraphed performance against anxiety, we would see that anxiety has a strong affect on performance. However, if we\ncalculated the correlation coef\ufb01cient, we would arrive at a \ufb01gure around zero. Therefore, the correlation coef\ufb01cient\nis not always the best statistic to use to understand the relationship between variables.\nOutliers\nThe correlation coef\ufb01cient is also very sensitive to outliers, or points that fall far away from the general trend of\nthe data. A single point that can greatly change the value of r, which means that the existence of outliers can either\nmask or in\ufb02ate the apparent strength of the linear relationship between two variables. In the graph below, r= 0.84\nif you include the outlier that falls well above the general trend of the rest of the data. However, if you ignore that\nsingle point, rincreases to 0.99. Because of this sensitivity, it is always important to plot your data before running a\ncorrelation analysis and investigate any outlying points carefully.\n111\n5.1. Scatterplots and Linear Correlation www.ck12.org\nHomogeneity of the Group (Restriction of Range)\nAnother error we could encounter when calculating the correlation coef\ufb01cient is homogeneity of the group. When\na group is homogeneous, or possesses similar characteristics, the range of scores on either or both of the variables\nis restricted. For example, suppose we are interested in \ufb01nding out the correlation between IQ and salary. If only\nmembers of the Mensa Club (a club for people with IQs over 140) are sampled, we will most likely \ufb01nd a very low\ncorrelation between IQ and salary, since most members will have a consistently high IQ, but their salaries will still\nvary. This does not mean that there is not a relationship-it simply means that the restriction of the sample limited the\nmagnitude of the correlation coef\ufb01cient. This is sometimes referred to as a \"restriction of range\" problem.\nSample Size\nFinally, we should consider sample size. One may assume that the number of observations used in the calculation\nof the correlation coef\ufb01cient may in\ufb02uence the magnitude of the coef\ufb01cient itself. However, this is not the case. Yet\nwhile the sample size does not affect the correlation coef\ufb01cient, it may affect the accuracy of the relationship. The\nlarger the sample, the more accurate of a predictor the correlation coef\ufb01cient will be of the relationship between the\ntwo variables.\nLesson Summary\nBivariate data are data sets with two observations that are assigned to the same subject. Correlation measures the\ndirection and magnitude of the linear relationship between bivariate data. When examining scatterplot graphs, we\ncan determine if correlations are positive, negative, perfect, or zero. A correlation is strong when the points in the\nscatterplot lie generally along a straight line.\n112\nwww.ck12.org Chapter 5. Relationships between Quantitative Variables\nThe correlation coef\ufb01cient is a precise measurement of the relationship between the two variables. This index can\ntake on values between and including \u00001:0 and +1.0.\nTo calculate the correlation coef\ufb01cient, we most often use one of the following two formulas when calculating the\ncoef\ufb01cient by hand.\nrXY=SP\n(n\u00001)(sx)(sy)\nwhere\nSP=\u00e5xy\u0000(\u00e5x)(\u00e5y)\nn\nor, alternatively from raw data alone,\nrXY=n\u00e5xy\u0000\u00e5x\u00e5yrh\nn\u00e5x2\u0000(\u00e5x)2irh\nn\u00e5y2\u0000(\u00e5y)2i.\nWhen calculating the correlation coef\ufb01cient, there are several things that could affect our computation, including\ncurvilinear relationships, homogeneity of the group, and the size of the group.\nReview Questions\n1.
